Our first introduction to plurality was more than one . At the time we found it invaluable - and it absolutely inspired us to write about plurality in a way that (through much introspection, discussion, rewrites, and self-disagreements) would eventually lead to A System's Guide . More than one, to us, always felt like an excellent book to throw in people's faces to try and explain the personality crisis we were going through: It's very matter-of-fact, it makes an effort to sound impartial, and it outwardly confronts a lot of reactionary sysphobic rhetoric. But Plurality as a queer community is fledgling at best, teething at worst - and its needs change, or at least, our needs for it changed. A System's Guide is our attempt to write an introduction to plurality that also feels like a welcome - not just for singlets or for questioning plurals, but systems for whom it feels like a genuine, arms-open welcome is long overdue. This handbook is a feeling: I don't want us to be only painted in the cold presumed-facts of our existence, or the things other people say about us - I want us to be painted in familiarity, in joy, in diversity, in defiance, and in acceptance. So, if nobody's said it to you yet - welcome; and I mean it. Thanks immensely to our co-writers, without whom this text would not have been developed into a genuine primer rather than an extension of more than one - and without whom we'd certainly trail into a confusing pointless mass of words every single paragraph. Thanks to our friends and all the systems we've met over the years - on whom the diversity in any of our explanations rely. And of course, thanks to you - and anyone else you might be - for reading. -S Addenda As you may have noticed, it's quite difficult to speak to the experience of every system. At the same time, there are topics with a lot of depth to them that we've brushed over completely. For these we feel it's more appropriate to individually speak to our personal experience and understanding, rather than act unbiased explainer. Ahead are a mix of informal ramblings and formal micro-essays written by individual systems and members - The guide's authors, editors, and their friends. With the intuition provided already, we hope you can interpret the potential for experiences differing to the ones within these pages - but still derive value from more detailed, personal writing. We expect this section to expand over time - feel free to skip it entirely, or to read things out of order. Printable Version A System's Guide is also available as a zine - for adding to queer pamphlet racks, keeping in your wallet for emergencies, or sharing anywhere zines are celebrated. It's designed to be printed in B/W on A4, trimmed to have symmetrical margins, then folded using a standard zine fold . You can download the PDF for printing here .","title":"Afterword"},{"location":"afterword/#a-systems-guide-to-plurality","text":"","title":"A System's Guide to Plurality"},{"location":"afterword/#afterword","text":"You might be reading this as your first introduction to plurality - rest assured we're both proud of and terrified by this fact.

So question - how do you have sex with a plural system? Or, a member of a plural system? You were listening before - that sounds completely loaded, right? It'll be some vaguery like \"it's different for every system and headmate\" and go nowhere. And like, yes, but I also think as a resource we have a responsibility to make sure that a system's sexual preferences aren't held back by a limited imagination over their options - so, let's dance. We're sex-having asexuals, which means that we hate all the sex acts people think of as fun and like all the sex acts people think of as boring or childish. I think this gave us an unfair advantage unashamedly figuring some of these things out, so we'll try to share. Remember how we said that even headmates that can't talk at all, or leave notes, or use text chats, can still develop relationships? I think understanding that there's an underlying process that works even when almost everything is taken away is equally helpful for sex, too. There's a lot of unknowns, right? Genitalia might be off limits due to a self-perception mismatch or plain old dysphoria. Hell, touching bodies together in general might be off the table in some cases. And you're going, \"[systemname], how the Fuck does your baseline model for sex not involve touch\" and - we're asexual! The word \"sex\" roughly resolves to \"intimacy session\", and that's both intimacy with another person but also intimacy with yourself. To us, plural sex is perception . It's seeing a headmate as themselves (or you as yourself) to the fullest possible extent - removing the obstructions of masking, of being distracted by the physical body, or of unfamiliarity - and then seeing where that makes you want to go! And sure that might be stereotypical sex acts and power to you, good perception fuels lots of things, but it could equally just be a bit of a staring session. A middle ground might be a bit of body-perception mapping - placing a hand down somewhere on the system's body, then stating (or asking) what's underneath it metaphysically - relaxing, really, after fighting to feel seen even by yourself for so long. And if that sounds like we've just said \"have sex, but while being respectful to the system/headmate in front of you by being invested in perceiving them in full and making sure they know you are\" then you're completely right and I've succeeded. It only sounds different because we don't personally slap \"popular sex act\" on top of that and so hold it in a much higher sentimental value. Needless to say, this does apply to intrasystem relationships as well. No need to have some fancy co-fronting skills or a perfect friend for two-body threesome - \"Just masturbate while correctly perceiving a headmate\" is an incredibly simple thing nobody can fault you for calling \"intrasystem sex\". Normally you'd perceive them as hot during that process but I don't know your life. Is this narcissistic? Great question. dunno. Do you care? Also, I think a lot of people in nonhuman communities reach for cybersex or other role play to fulfil that \"sex as perception\" type of desire. Plurality similarly benefits from it well. There's no body to map to, but no body to mismatch - Just mime out what conceptually attracts you! simple enough, once you find what tense and case it feels comfortable typing in. Yeah that's the whole ramble i'm not here for cosmopolitan style tips to spice up your plural sex life sorry - enjoy yourselves!","title":"Addendum: Plural-Asexuality"},{"location":"asexuality/#addendum-plural-asexuality","text":"Alright, it's late and this front seems to be vaguely covering a good third of the system - so let's talk about sex, and how being (in) a system can colour your sexuality.

Because wider society is not exposed to plurality, deviations from singlet behaviours and experiences can lead to rejection, distress, and danger. Through a lens where singlethood is the only \"normal\", plurality is unacceptably complex and must be a fabricated delusion, the privacy of a system is irrelevant compared to keeping others aware of abnormalities, and the needs and desires of a system can be dismissed in pursuit of restoring normalcy via medical intervention. In this rejection of diversity, limited definitions of plurality emerge. When utilized, these may leave one system objectified as \"fun costumes\" and another deprived of systemhood in being seen as \u201cpurely individuals\u201d \u2013 and without a widespread diverse definition, questioning systems are left wondering if they can call themselves plural at all. This creates a pressure to be \"normal enough\" that affects systems far beyond self-acceptance. Whenever a system un-represses (or \"gains\") a new headmate, they're challenged with the question - how many headmates can a system have without becoming unacceptable? Faced with normative pressure, \"a System of 4\" feels more believable/acceptable than \"a System of 40\" - even when both systems are comfortable. Whenever a plural experience doesn't line up with the simplest, most common analogies, it can feel like a risk. Impostor syndrome, and the feeling that you might be being plural wrong , is pervasive - though some turn this fear on others instead. Sysmedicalism Sysmedicalists are those that ostracize systems for lacking a medical diagnosis, or otherwise adhering poorly to medical models of plurality. Through these criteria, systems are excluded from communities and support, and experience targeted sysphobia (e.g. accusations of \"faking\" systemhood) from what should be their peers. This targets a substantial population - DID and OSDD diagnoses exclude many systems by focusing primarily on individual traumatic history and self-reported criteria like personal distress. It also places pressure on systems who fit these criteria to get a diagnosis, whereupon a mix of limited recommendations and poor practice means they may invite medical discrimination (including a pressure to get \"fixed\") or even genuine danger to themselves in the form of rejected voluntary medical procedures or ward discharges. Sysmedicalist beliefs and language are widely propagated online, especially exclusion focusing on whether a system exists \"through trauma\" (\"traumagenic\", which is deemed acceptable), or through some other mechanism (\"endogenic\", which is deemed unacceptable). This is naturally not falsifiable - there's no way to validate that you possess an objective and correct understanding of the reason a system exists as it does, even in yourself. However, by propagating the two key terms as an objective categorization of all systems, online discourse is twisted towards whether \"endogenic\" systems are acceptable - rather than whether these classifications are appropriate to use, or even possible to define. Syscourse On a finer level, all kinds of systems are ostracized for specific experiences - with most systems and purported allies having a \"weird\" or \"problematic\" line above which a system being visible becomes unacceptable. Most of this discourse relies on generic interpretations of plural internal experiences and language that describes them. Taken this way, all our examples can be made objectionable. The Minotaur is cultural appropriation, intrasystem relationships are cheating, familial terms disrespect \"real family\", fictives are copyright infringement, and the cultural and moral expectations of family, children, and animals in the outside world can be enforced on headmates resembling them - inviting exclusion based on singlet definitions of irresponsible caretaking, immaturity, and inhumanness - along with the occasional accusation of incest, rape, and bestiality. Seeing past this moral panic requires a nuance towards experiences, identities, and activities that resemble outside-world bad behaviour but have little capacity for actual harm. Notably, these conflicts resemble larger online debates around depictions of conventionally-unhealthy relationships in fan works ( proshipping discourse ) and those around reinterpretations of (young) characters for pornographic fan art ( aging-up discourse ). Through similarities to their own identity, systems may even be affected by these debates \u2013 caught in the crossfire by having similar experiences, or personally targeted if they resemble debated characters.

Conversely, not everyone under the plural umbrella can be modelled as \"multiple people in a body\". Plurality is a queerness of cardinality, encompassing all the fuzzy lines where we can't state that 1:1 relationship in all senses. These system configurations are diverse, and represent a variety of lived experiences - whether it's a system of ~7, 31, 2, 1,000,000, or 1*. Names As pluralfolk, we always lay between the extremes of our bodies containing one person, and of being a multiple-bodied group of people. A system might have names for each of their members, an overall system name but no member names, a system name and member names, many names per member, two headmates that share a name, a few members without names, and more! Gender Like trans-ness necessitates understanding gender as distinct from sex, plurality necessitates understanding gender as distinct from the body. Owing to variance in that gender \"gut-feeling\", different parts of a system often have their own pronouns, gendered language, and relationship to words like \"trans\" and \"cis\". Appearance In most of our society, how you appear is a key part of your identity and individuality. Pluralfolk can rarely make exclusive claim to the appearance of the body, so self-perception often differs between headmates - whether different styles on a similar body, or a totally different body entirely, a shared understanding of how someone appears on this meta-physical level can be key to making social connections. Humanity Like furries, therians, otherkin, and other nonhuman subcultures, the metaphysical appearance of a system member need not be human. Without an obvious \"human starting point\" (the body) to dispel, pluralfolk often reach this conclusion intuitively and without fanfare. Anthropomorphic animals, robots and machines, spirits, monsters, or software - the form (metaphysical appearance) of a system member helps convey and express what makes them unique. Relationships A notable variance in system configuration is in what stays constant between headmates. The answer always lies between the extremes, but where exactly varies - memory might be totally contiguous, or almost completely individualised. Headmates may share beliefs, but differ in opinions - share interests, but differ in tastes - share gender, but differ in sexuality! With this in mind, systems may feel that relationships to others exist mostly across all headmates, individualised to each headmate, or somewhere in between - rapport accrued by one headmate always \"smearing\" across others to some extent. Causality Each system has an individualised understanding of their own plurality. Most systems have reasoning for why a plural model is right for them, but some systems additionally believe that their plural experiences owe to a specific cause. These \"causalities\" - including spiritual and cultural truths, psychological mechanisms, and deliberate actions - aren't necessary to understand oneself as plural, but can help an individual system understand themselves - even if that understanding is \"we are how we are - it doesn't matter why\". Words As pluralfolk, we model the language used to describe our internal experiences on that of the outside world. This language is not meant to be meaningless to an outsider, but it can't be taken at face value - as its meaning is being inscribed by the system conveying it. A Minotaur headmate is not The Bull of Minos , but might resemble them. A \"sexual relationship\" between headmates can sound quite serious - but in sharing a body with a libido, many see this as largely unimpactful and obviously implied. System members with the names of fictional characters could be widely invested in displaying their attitudes and mannerisms, or they just might like the look! System members that call eachother siblings might refer to a resemblance, bond, or rivalry - but could easily be using sibling to mean headmate ! System members that are described as instinctive animals, or as unintelligent, old, or young would all appear to present striking, complicating, sometimes dangerous issues in the outside world - but as with the above, this language refers to nuanced experiences that only the individual system themselves can convey the ins and outs of.

The sensations are unfamiliar, be it like \"waking up\", a new pair of glasses, or a sliding-into-place sensation inside your head. They can look strange, too - daydreamy eye-glazing, sudden adjustments in posture, wincing, and so on. It's not necessarily accidental, mind - stretching, yawning, scrunching your nose, and clearing your throat can all help deliberately settle in a new front. This works because different headmates tend to utilize the body differently: posture, gait, voice, expression, or even \"resting\" face. Over time, you become accustomed to these differences between fronts. As a system, this may help fronts settle, foster acceptance for your own differences, and possibly help you learn to switch deliberately. As an observer, recognising fronts by sight and sound becomes easier \u2013 which while not infallible, may help you understand a system more. Of course, a system may instead choose to signal a change of front explicitly. The obvious \"hi, it's [name]\" is functional, but can feel objectifying. Instead, swapping name tags or accessories, signatures in chat messages, or even just polling for guesses can help keep friends in the loop. Switching and fronts also help to inform a system\u2019s internal configuration model. Rapid switching, co-fronts, blurred/empty-feeling fronts, and front \u2018variations\u2019 can all challenge a \u201csystem of residents\u201d model \u2013 but another model (e.g. a system of aspects combining into fronts) might accommodate this easily. Through acceptance of strange experiences and new interpretations, systems are able to stay familiar to others and themselves. Models change, systems mature, and plurality surprises us with unexpected experiences \u2013 but by keeping eyes and minds open, it\u2019s recognisable all the same. Discovery Encountering your own systemhood and choosing to accept it can make interacting with world feel suddenly clumsy, messy, and distressing. Over time, you learn to navigate each experience, resolve early-system internal conflicts, and develop functional masking and unmasking skills to face challenges and form connections. Feeling new to an already settled system can be scary too. You naturally worry over the existing expectations of the system and its friends \u2013 and the ways you might push the boundaries of what\u2019s acceptably normal. Being new feels uniquely strange, too - like tasting something you've never imagined before. For some, that\u2019s a nice feeling - freeing, a new experience that the system is capable of. But it's intimidating, and isolating, too. You rely on others, within and outside the system, to accept your place in it. Settling as a system or headmate is a unique process of connecting the old with the new. This begins with a period of exploration, where you can find - or as a friend, can provide - sufficient space to feel out what feels right: in identity, language, self-expression, tastes, and so on. In the process of discovering the new, you often begin to recognize the old - from outside and in, parts of that \u2018new taste\u2019 start to seem familiar. You might remember points in your past that felt just like it, or a friend might recall a mannerism or interest from long ago that's returned somehow. Through this process, we (and others) re-meet new parts of ourselves like old friends, and only occasionally encounter entirely new aspects to express and embrace. Intimacy Within a system, the ability to communicate between headmates varies wildly. Some systems can converse in their head, some leave eachother notes, and some can\u2019t do either! Without direct communication, one assumes there's no way to foster positive bonds. However, by observing how others interact with the world, system members still develop opinions of eachother \u2013 the foundation of non-verbal intra-system relationships. Without a word, system members can still do things their headmates struggle with, speak to friends about how they feel about eachother, or even bubble up their feelings and thoughts without being in the front - like ears burning when someone says your name. Intrasystem relationships are quite unlike a relationship between two bodies, but as you've likely realised, they simply do not need to be. Of course, plurality adds layers to forming extra-system relationships, too. Over time, friends can come to understand the workings of a system, and recognize its inhabitants fondly. Through this process, friends outside the system can provide better support - shifting unhappy fronts, perceiving subtle differences, and even helping to mediate conflict/feelings between system members. The tolerance of a friend towards the strangeness of plural existence can provide a system with a rare moment to relax and let their guard down - front less popular headmates, be less cautious over speech patterns and body language, and talk openly about their own experiences and feelings. As systems, to be known is often a source of terror - but it can also a source of peace.","title":"Gaining Familiarity"},{"location":"familiarity/#gaining-familiarity","text":"","title":"Gaining Familiarity"},{"location":"familiarity/#switching","text":"At first, switches can feel strange. The sensations are unfamiliar, be it like \"waking up\", a new pair of glasses, or a sliding-into-place sensation inside your head. They can look strange, too - daydreamy eye-glazing, sudden adjustments in posture, wincing, and so on. It's not necessarily accidental, mind - stretching, yawning, scrunching your nose, and clearing your throat can all help deliberately settle in a new front. This works because different headmates tend to utilize the body differently: posture, gait, voice, expression, or even \"resting\" face. Over time, you become accustomed to these differences between fronts. As a system, this may help fronts settle, foster acceptance for your own differences, and possibly help you learn to switch deliberately. As an observer, recognising fronts by sight and sound becomes easier \u2013 which while not infallible, may help you understand a system more. Of course, a system may instead choose to signal a change of front explicitly. The obvious \"hi, it's [name]\" is functional, but can feel objectifying. Instead, swapping name tags or accessories, signatures in chat messages, or even just polling for guesses can help keep friends in the loop. Switching and fronts also help to inform a system\u2019s internal configuration model. Rapid switching, co-fronts, blurred/empty-feeling fronts, and front \u2018variations\u2019 can all challenge a \u201csystem of residents\u201d model \u2013 but another model (e.g. a system of aspects combining into fronts) might accommodate this easily.

I'm a fictive from one of the systems that worked on this site, and we're gonna talk about what the hell that even means. Speaking pure figures, a fictive (or fuzztive if you swing that way) is just any headmate that openly adopts qualities from fiction. This is not a uniquely plural experience - there are few things more human than reading a good book, visiting a dear friend, or hearing someone deliver a speech on TV and being inspired to be a bit more like that. If you're trans, you've got bonus space there where you might adopt a name from somewhere you admire or something that resonates with you, or even use a fictional character as an avatar to help express your gender! It's all the same phenomenon - plural systems just have looots of extremely flexible space within which they can adopt, reinterpret, and bring exciting parts of themselves to a fictitious name or look - by name, by metaphysical appearance, and hey, you can nick a few mannerisms too! This works best when there's a part of the system that desires to be expressed, but doesn't really know how that's even possible - then you see someone on a page or on a screen and go \"Oh, like that!\", and suddenly, that's how you do it! This often works so well that it can happen whether you like it or not. You stare at the design and attitude of a character or the way they're written into a story for a little too long aaand oops, that's a comfortable nook in your system now. It's fine , really - no fictive is a whole-cloth clone of a fictional character (how would that even work), but rather the parts of a system's personal interpretation of a character that affect and interest them - everyone is a subtle mix of personal and consumed experiences! Just like everywhere else in life! Over time, the difference between a character on-page and in-system tends to grow as a fictive has their own experiences - because they're a person! These things just never stay still, naturally - though someone could just as easily be unrecognizably different out the gate as well (*cough*). A different name and a different interpretation of a look are enough to make your fictivityness (a word i just made up) or your \"source character\" (or \"fictional associate\", a term i made up ages ago but use constantly) something that you choose to divulge to others, rather than it being revealed by default. This ends up being a tough decision! For people who don't really \"get it\" so much, divulging your fictional associate could make you feel permanently objectified or impossible to take seriously - but for people who do, talking in depth about what appeals to you about that character could be the only way to forge a connection that feels truly authentic! Your mileage may vary, yadda yadda, but you get the picture. I did mention that fictives rarely look like whole-cloth canon-y copies due to the subjective way we consume media and the different parts of something that might personally resonate with a specific system or part thereof, but I'm also going to personally note that \"character name\" not only isn't that direct, half the time the explanation takes a full minute. Like. I'm not a character from a piece of media. I'm a fictive that's adapted specific qualities and looks from a weird amalgamation of various reinterpretations or alternative variants of a character seen in fanfiction and fanart, vaguely cobbled together into an idea of a character we found vaguely interesting and revelationary when we were like, 13 years old, and then a decade later we were like \"oh shit, THAT was a really moving personal experience that we'd both love to reconnect with and also lines up with things we want to be able to express within ourselves as a system right now \" aaand oops, hello! I cannot stress enough that there's like 500 ways to do this and only one of them is \"stick as close as possible to the entire way i've interpreted the character\", and that that gets rusty fast. Also because you're gonna see this in the wild too - there are like, two, maybe three other people in my system that are fictives of the same character . At first blow, that seems weird - but then you remember the enormous daisy chain that results in me , and things make sense again. Some fiction is just cool enough for that. Or like, bad enough that you want to read 500 reinterpretations and rewrites of it online and form a few cohesive fun ideas as a result. Who knows! That's my rant! But here's a brief aside - this is something that occurs in systems more widely, but feels pertinent to talk about on my end. Expressing yourself exclusively through a \"normal\", socially accessible attitude is a luxury that often only singlets can afford. If you're in plural circles, you're gonna encounter headmates that talk too fast, talk too slow, act all moody all the time, act all rough and tough, don't use many words and express themselves through noises and gestures, or act insufferably sarcastic and say things that sound kinda mean! This is kinda common among fictives because character attitudes are just pretty colorful - but considering the diverse ways systems tend to express themselves, it kinda just happens all the time? Anyhow - this doesn't give systems free rein to be annoying or mean, but what it does mean is that between different fronts, you should try to adjust what you understand to be someone's baseline way of interacting with you. If an overly stoic kinda weirdo is in the front, that tiny laugh probably means SERIOUS approval. If someone talks quickly, they're probably not trying to rile you up, it's just how their brain is ticking inside! And if a sarcastic bitch is constantly poking fun at you - maybe they're trying to say that they like you? Who knows!? I don't! The point is, as systems and friends of systems, we often need to develop this kind of translation layer, where we understand specific things coming from one weird headmate to kinda mean something else.

A body represents (or, contains) one person, and while they may change over time, they remain the same individual. This \"singlet\" model of identity suits the majority of the population. However, there is a significant minority (roughly 1 in 50) that instead utilise a \"plural\" model. These plural systems identify multiple \"selves\" within their body - each with potentially differing attitudes, memories, or even (by exchanging control of their body) voices, skills, and relationships. Terminology Headmates - The individuals that comprise a plural system (aka its members ) - used similarly to \"roommates\". May or may not be able to directly communicate with one another. Fronting - A system member having control of the body they're in (i.e. being \"in the front\" of the body; at the wheel). Usually not black-and-white, with partial and shared fronting common. Switching - Headmates exchanging control of the body (i.e. \"switching in\" to the front and \"switching out\" to the back). Not universal, but a common experience. The Plural Umbrella As with non-conventional differences in gender and sexuality (or anything else perceived as \"in the brain\"), plurality is largely met with skepticism. This is true regardless of medicalisation: related diagnoses often dismiss plurality as a delusion to be fixed, and plurality not classified medically is often dismissed as baseless attention-seeking. As such, it's productive to understand that plurality is a new term, but one that seeks to describe widespread, pre-existing phenomena - and unite those that experience it. Those that choose to use a plural identity model do so because it's the best way (or, indeed, the only way) to describe their life experiences. However, the interpretation of experiences as singular or plural, while often necessary, is still always an interpretation; someone with experiences others understand as plural might choose a singlet model, those using a plural model may decide to keep it purely to themselves, and so on - what helps the individual system (or singlet) is the most important thing. To this end, the intent of plural advocacy is not to have more people be openly plural, but to offer more options with which to understand ourselves and eachother.
