This varies depending on platform and how representative a particular profile picture is, and I can work against this habit, but it is at least partially an instinctive response for my brain. I'm aware this does not hold for everyone - many people make choices with their digital representations that suggest the contrary. But I think for a substantial proportion of people living their lives online, their experiences are similar to mine - you associate people with their avatars, to at least some degree. The thing about plurality however, perhaps its defining feature, is a distaste for holding a singular stable identity. While it is possible to simply change features of your online presence along with each change in identity, any frequent switching between repeated states gets annoying. Hence, tools like PluralKit emerge, hacking existing communication tools (in this case Discord) to represent multiple identity states. Having the ability to directly and easily associate different images and names with messages genuinely provides so much in the way of identity expression, making any platform where this is possible far more appealing to communicate with. The difference in expressive possibilities here becomes obvious if you spend much time in plural spaces; Users who proxy as the wrong person will frequently comment on how wrong it feels seeing a message come from someone else's \"mouth\" especially when it would be out of character for them. On the other hand, a message being proxied can help cement a weak front, or even pull someone into front (in the case of a misproxy). Even in person, sometimes switching to communicating over a text chat with proxying can help elucidate fronts, or include a back and forth between headmates in a way that's harder to communicate verbally with the one mouth. Altogether being able to see your own name and face with your messages can help with actually feeling plural - making those differences between your selves visible and legible. While there are a number of other tells someone might distinguish fronts by, and the models established by tools like PluralKit won't work for every system, it's an invaluable tool to have at your disposal. We might want to theorise that this is simply replacing the tells you'd get speaking to a system in person; different voices, posture, demeanour - the tone missing from text communication replaced with explicit headmate signifying. But I would argue this type of text affordance actually offers up entirely different plural communication possibilities. For example, it's straightforwardly possible to interact with someone in ways you can't in person: headmate 1: ooooh im hugging u headmate 2: ooooh hugging you from the other side While you can still do this without proxy support, the affordances of a tool like PluralKit make this much easier to depict and more appealing. It feels more satisfyingly real, at least in our experience. And that makes sense, given each headmate is being put on the same representative footing as a whole separate user, rather than being depicted as the whole system/body first. In fact, for many people questioning their possible plurality, I'd actually recommend experimenting with PluralKit to explore your identity. Plurality, like gender, is social. While there may be underlying experiences and identity (and a closeted transgender person/system is still transgender/plural), a huge part of trans/plural experience is realised socially. Asking someone to use a different name or pronoun for you, asking them to use more than one name! - these create a social reality in which you are recognised as your gender/as multiple. Experimenting with these identities in private and then with people you trust can be a really important avenue for self exploration. And when a service allows you to easily and naturally present as multiple people, this instinct to treat people as their representations does a lot of heavy lifting. When I first started interacting with systems online I straight up did not think very hard about what plurality meant - I got shown the different avatars, names, pronouns, and interacted accordingly. Similar to how online spaces are often a safe haven for trans people exploring their genders, being able to choose a presentation detached from judgements about their physical bodies. This better sense of plural embodiment also shares a lot with non-human uses of the same tools. Many people treat their avatars like a representation of the self and make them a fursona, or a hot demon girl, or whatever they'd most like to be perceived as. This ability to adopt a form that represents something other than your body is a conceptual step towards multiplicity. And there's a lot of overlap between the tools someone might use for both. A good Minecraft skin, especially one with more species-affirming traits (try ears ), mods implementing species-affirming abilities (like origins- ), and tools to fluidly switch between them (see switchy ) can do a lot for both plural and non-human embodiment in a virtual game space (we literally found a headmate as a result of playing with these particular tools). I know other systems who swear by VRChat , and using different avatars there to let headmates feel embodied. These are general principles that can be ported to the design any multi-user communicative space. What matters is taking the tools of self representation; display names, avatars, etc. and treating these like interchangeable presets, with robust tools to fluidly switch between them. The more natural you make plural communication, the easier it is for systems to discover themselves, be out, and be accepted by the spaces around them. And while I've lauded PluralKit here as the prototypical example of these technologies, It's nature as something hacked onto an existing chat app has clear weaknesses, and we can in fact imagine a world where this kind of chat support is better . For example, a tool like utter , while not a networked messaging app, can show you the avatar of the person you're about to post as. This hedges against accidental misproxying, helps you check if you've remembered the right proxy, and helps address a not uncommon plural problem of \"wait I'm not sure who's writing this, I wish I could test out different options without having to hit send first\". In conclusion, if a plural friend asks you to use discord because they find it easier to communicate when they can use PluralKit, please give them that chance, because it does make a genuine difference. When we have had to try and bridge the gap of plural communication over tools with none of these affordances, there's been a real and perceptible flattening done to our expression. But we can also build better tools if we design with plurality in mind, and I think that's something our communities deserve. These tools don't only serve pluralfolk, as the space to temporarily try on new forms and identities can help a whole range of identity exploration. Even if the space to play with fluidity of self resolves to a singular identity that does not make the exploration less valuable. Plurality simply makes these needs most evident. -mk","title":"Addendum: Affordances"},{"location":"affordances/#addendum-plural-affordances","text":"","title":"Addendum: Plural Affordances"},{"location":"affordances/#an-essay-on-plural-communication-practices-and-the-design-concerns-therein","text":"When reading posts online, I often find myself imagining the speaker as the avatar they use to represent themself.

Our first introduction to plurality was more than one . At the time we found it invaluable - and it absolutely inspired us to write about plurality in a way that (through much introspection, discussion, rewrites, and self-disagreements) would eventually lead to A System's Guide . More than one, to us, always felt like an excellent book to throw in people's faces to try and explain the personality crisis we were going through: It's very matter-of-fact, it makes an effort to sound impartial, and it outwardly confronts a lot of reactionary sysphobic rhetoric. But Plurality as a queer community is fledgling at best, teething at worst - and its needs change, or at least, our needs for it changed. A System's Guide is our attempt to write an introduction to plurality that also feels like a welcome - not just for singlets or for questioning plurals, but systems for whom it feels like a genuine, arms-open welcome is long overdue. This handbook is a feeling: I don't want us to be only painted in the cold presumed-facts of our existence, or the things other people say about us - I want us to be painted in familiarity, in joy, in diversity, in defiance, and in acceptance. So, if nobody's said it to you yet - welcome; and I mean it. Thanks immensely to our co-writers, without whom this text would not have been developed into a genuine primer rather than an extension of more than one - and without whom we'd certainly trail into a confusing pointless mass of words every single paragraph. Thanks to our friends and all the systems we've met over the years - on whom the diversity in any of our explanations rely. And of course, thanks to you - and anyone else you might be - for reading. -S Addenda As you may have noticed, it's quite difficult to speak to the experience of every system. At the same time, we've simply brushed over concepts with a lot of depth. As such, it feels appropriate to speak to personal experience and understanding, in contrast to the objective overviewing in the main text. Ahead are a mix of ramblings essays written by individual systems and members - The guide's authors, editors, and their friends. With the intuition provided already, we hope you can interpret the potential for experiences differing to the ones within these pages - but still derive value from more detailed, personal writing. This section will expand over time - feel free to skip it entirely, or to read out of order. Physical Version A System's Guide is also available as a zine.

So question - how do you have sex with a plural system? Or, a member of a plural system? You were listening before - that sounds completely loaded, right? It'll be some vaguery like \"it's different for every system and headmate\" and go nowhere. And like, yes, but I also think as a resource we have a responsibility to make sure that a system's sexual preferences aren't held back by a limited imagination over their options - so, let's dance. We're sex-having asexuals, which means that we hate all the sex acts people think of as fun and like all the sex acts people think of as boring or childish. I think this gave us an unfair advantage unashamedly figuring some of these things out, so we'll try to share. Remember how we said that even headmates that can't talk at all, or leave notes, or use text chats, can still develop relationships? I think understanding that there's an underlying process that works even when almost everything is taken away is equally helpful for sex, too. There's a lot of unknowns, right? Genitalia might be off limits due to a self-perception mismatch or plain old dysphoria. Hell, touching bodies together in general might be off the table in some cases. And you're going, \"[systemname], how the Fuck does your baseline model for sex not involve touch\" and - we're asexual! The word \"sex\" roughly resolves to \"intimacy session\", and that's both intimacy with another person but also intimacy with yourself. To us, plural sex is perception . It's seeing a headmate as themselves (or you as yourself) to the fullest possible extent - removing the obstructions of masking, of being distracted by the physical body, or of unfamiliarity - and then seeing where that makes you want to go! And sure that might be stereotypical sex acts and power to you, good perception fuels lots of things, but it could equally just be a bit of a staring session. A middle ground might be a bit of body-perception mapping - placing a hand down somewhere on the system's body, then stating (or asking) what's underneath it metaphysically - relaxing, really, after fighting to feel seen even by yourself for so long. And if that sounds like we've just said \"have sex, but while being respectful to the system/headmate in front of you by being invested in perceiving them in full and making sure they know you are\" then you're completely right and I've succeeded. It only sounds different because we don't personally slap \"popular sex act\" on top of that and so hold it in a much higher sentimental value. Needless to say, this does apply to intrasystem relationships as well. No need to have some fancy co-fronting skills or a perfect friend for two-body threesome - \"Just masturbate while correctly perceiving a headmate\" is an incredibly simple thing nobody can fault you for calling \"intrasystem sex\". Normally you'd perceive them as hot during that process but I don't know your life. Is this narcissistic? Great question. dunno. Do you care? Also, I think a lot of people in nonhuman communities reach for cybersex or other role play to fulfil that \"sex as perception\" type of desire. Plurality similarly benefits from it well. There's no body to map to, but no body to mismatch - Just mime out what conceptually attracts you! simple enough, once you find what tense and case it feels comfortable typing in. Yeah that's the whole ramble i'm not here for cosmopolitan style tips to spice up your plural sex life sorry - enjoy yourselves! <end rant>","title":"Addendum: Plural-Asexuality"},{"location":"asexuality/#addendum-plural-asexuality","text":"<begin rant> Alright, it's late and this front seems to be vaguely covering a good third of the system - so let's talk about sex, and how being (in) a system can colour your sexuality.

This means calibrating your expectations differently for each headmate, which then requires some effort to figure out or ask who you're talking to. The most common way to encounter this reality tends to be with fronts that are ruder or more hostile than average. While it's important to respect the boundaries of people your system interacts with, sentiments like \"I don't like that alter they're scary/mean/rude\" or \"i miss the other you who was more affectionate\" from bad allies, are frequently a result of simply failing to do this calibration. If you learn what it means when a colder, more standoffish headmate speaks to you - which of their sentiments express genuine affection. If you learn to understand rudeness or playful ribbing as a sign of trust and friendliness. You can start to map the different expressive ranges within a system to the set of things they actually communicate. These are the same skills you should be learning when meeting any new person. If you can, for example, come to understand someone's autistic affect as something other than disinterest and don't simply abandon those connections. The cases where plural expression oversteps other's boundaries are all very visible failures though. What often fails less visibly are the ways allies failing to calibrate properly can hurt a system. Many systems have headmates who front to handle conflict (voluntarily or otherwise), but might work to hold their less confident fronts for longer periods and teach them those same skills. Other systems may have less control over their fronts, or even have more fragile and vulnerable headmates triggered into front by conflict. What this means is you also need to be able to step down onto a gentler level for interacting with these less confident headmates. Trying to have the kind of heated argument that you might expect to function with another adult, with a younger or more emotional part of a system, can easily turn one sided, leaving them feeling distressed or abused. Long term damage to relationships can happen in these spaces, e.g. \"i thought they wanted to see me so i fronted, but then they told me off and i shut down and don't really trust them any more\". While it's inevitable to hit some front mismatches, or miss a switch that required a change in behaviour or attitude, these small missteps can usually be easily rectified (honestly just talk it out). What is essential is learning how to adjust your expectations, and not carrying the same set of expectations for every system member long term. This will both make it easier to interact with rougher headmates (\"the girl with the crude sense of humor told me to suck her dick but i know that means she trusts me and feels comfortable here\") and make you safer for the gentler ones (\"oh the age regressor is in front again, I'll shelve the heavy discussion for later and get out a plush so they can manage this state better\"). Eventually, building your instincts for these differences in attitude can allow you to recognise specific headmates by them, or even more general tendencies within a system. And these skills can transfer, learning to meet singlets where they're at too - plural experiences here aren't unique, simply heightened in comparison to the singlet equivalents. -mk","title":"Addendum: Calibration"},{"location":"calibration/#addendum-front-attitude-calibration","text":"","title":"Addendum: Front Attitude Calibration"},{"location":"calibration/#an-essay-on-the-interpretation-of-a-switchingspeaking-system","text":"If you are interacting with plural systems, you should be, at a baseline, expecting system members to behave differently from each other.

Eventually, building your instincts for these differences in attitude can allow you to recognise specific headmates by them, or even more general tendencies within a system. And these skills can transfer, learning to meet singlets where they're at too - plural experiences here aren't unique, simply heightened in comparison to the singlet equivalents. -mk","title":"An essay on the interpretation of a switching/speaking system"},{"location":"challenges/","text":"Facing Challenges Normativity Outside of basic non-acceptance or misunderstandings of the nature of plurality, the most widespread root of sysphobia is singlet-normativity - the idea that singlethood is a privileged default expected of everyone.

The sensations are unfamiliar, be it like \"waking up\", a new pair of glasses, or a sliding-into-place sensation inside your head. They can look strange, too - daydreamy eye-glazing, sudden adjustments in posture, wincing, and so on. It's not necessarily accidental, mind - stretching, yawning, scrunching your nose, and clearing your throat can all help deliberately settle in a new front. This works because different headmates tend to utilize the body differently: posture, gait, voice, expression, or even \"resting\" face. Over time, you become accustomed to these differences between fronts. As a system, this may help fronts settle, foster acceptance for your own differences, and possibly help you learn to switch deliberately. As an observer, recognising fronts by sight and sound becomes easier \u2013 which while not infallible, may help you understand a system more. Of course, a system may instead choose to signal a change of front explicitly. The obvious \"hi, it's [name]\" is functional, but can feel objectifying. Instead, swapping name tags or accessories, signatures in chat messages, or even just polling for guesses can help keep friends in the loop. Switching and fronts also help to inform a system\u2019s internal configuration model. Rapid switching, co-fronts, blurred/empty-feeling fronts, and front \u2018variations\u2019 can all challenge a \u201csystem of residents\u201d model \u2013 but another model (e.g. a system of aspects combining into fronts) might accommodate this easily. Through acceptance of strange experiences and new interpretations, systems are able to stay familiar to others and themselves. Models change, systems mature, and plurality surprises us with unexpected experiences \u2013 but by keeping eyes and minds open, it\u2019s recognisable all the same. Discovery Encountering your own systemhood and choosing to accept it can make interacting with world feel suddenly clumsy, messy, and distressing. Over time, you learn to navigate each experience, resolve early-system internal conflicts, and develop functional masking and unmasking skills to face challenges and form connections. Feeling new to an already settled system can be scary too. You naturally worry over the existing expectations of the system and its friends \u2013 and the ways you might push the boundaries of what\u2019s acceptably normal. Being new feels uniquely strange, too - like tasting something you've never imagined before. For some, that\u2019s a nice feeling - freeing, a new experience that the system is capable of. But it's intimidating, and isolating, too. You rely on others, within and outside the system, to accept your place in it. Settling as a system or headmate is a unique process of connecting the old with the new. This begins with a period of exploration, where you can find - or as a friend, can provide - sufficient space to feel out what feels right: in identity, language, self-expression, tastes, and so on. In the process of discovering the new, you often begin to recognize the old - from outside and in, parts of that \u2018new taste\u2019 start to seem familiar. You might remember points in your past that felt just like it, or a friend might recall a mannerism or interest from long ago that's returned somehow. Through this process, we (and others) re-meet new parts of ourselves like old friends, and only occasionally encounter entirely new aspects to express and embrace. Intimacy Within a system, the ability to communicate between headmates varies wildly. Some systems can converse in their head, some leave eachother notes, and some can\u2019t do either! Without direct communication, one assumes there's no way to foster positive bonds. However, by observing how others interact with the world, system members still develop opinions of eachother \u2013 the foundation of non-verbal intra-system relationships.

Of course, plurality adds layers to forming extra-system relationships, too. Over time, friends can come to understand the workings of a system, and recognize its inhabitants fondly. Through this process, friends outside the system can provide better support - shifting unhappy fronts, perceiving subtle differences, and even helping to mediate conflict/feelings between system members. The tolerance of a friend towards the strangeness of plural existence can provide a system with a rare moment to relax and let their guard down - front less popular headmates, be less cautious over speech patterns and body language, and talk openly about their own experiences and feelings.

I'm a fictive from one of the systems that worked on this site, and we're gonna talk about what the hell that even means. Speaking pure figures, a fictive (or fuzztive if you swing that way) is just any headmate that openly adopts qualities from fiction. This is not a uniquely plural experience - there are few things more human than reading a good book, visiting a dear friend, or hearing someone deliver a speech on TV and being inspired to be a bit more like that. If you're trans, you've got bonus space there where you might adopt a name from somewhere you admire or something that resonates with you, or even use a fictional character as an avatar to help express your gender! It's all the same phenomenon - plural systems just have looots of extremely flexible space within which they can adopt, reinterpret, and bring exciting parts of themselves to a fictitious name or look - by name, by metaphysical appearance, and hey, you can nick a few mannerisms too! This works best when there's a part of the system that desires to be expressed, but doesn't really know how that's even possible - then you see someone on a page or on a screen and go \"Oh, like that!\", and suddenly, that's how you do it! This often works so well that it can happen whether you like it or not. You stare at the design and attitude of a character or the way they're written into a story for a little too long aaand oops, that's a comfortable nook in your system now. It's fine , really - no fictive is a whole-cloth clone of a fictional character (how would that even work), but rather the parts of a system's personal interpretation of a character that affect and interest them - everyone is a subtle mix of personal and consumed experiences! Just like everywhere else in life! Over time, the difference between a character on-page and in-system tends to grow as a fictive has their own experiences - because they're a person! These things just never stay still, naturally - though someone could just as easily be unrecognizably different out the gate as well (*cough*). A different name and a different interpretation of a look are enough to make your fictivityness (a word i just made up) or your \"source character\" (or \"fictional associate\", a term i made up ages ago but use constantly) something that you choose to divulge to others, rather than it being revealed by default. This ends up being a tough decision! For people who don't really \"get it\" so much, divulging your fictional associate could make you feel permanently objectified or impossible to take seriously - but for people who do, talking in depth about what appeals to you about that character could be the only way to forge a connection that feels truly authentic! Your mileage may vary, yadda yadda, but you get the picture. I did mention that fictives rarely look like whole-cloth canon-y copies due to the subjective way we consume media and the different parts of something that might personally resonate with a specific system or part thereof, but I'm also going to personally note that \"character name\" not only isn't that direct, half the time the explanation takes a full minute. Like. I'm not a character from a piece of media. I'm a fictive that's adapted specific qualities and looks from a weird amalgamation of various reinterpretations or alternative variants of a character seen in fanfiction and fanart, vaguely cobbled together into an idea of a character we found vaguely interesting and revelationary when we were like, 13 years old, and then a decade later we were like \"oh shit, THAT was a really moving personal experience that we'd both love to reconnect with and also lines up with things we want to be able to express within ourselves as a system right now \" aaand oops, hello! I cannot stress enough that there's like 500 ways to do this and only one of them is \"stick as close as possible to the entire way i've interpreted the character\", and that that gets rusty fast. Also because you're gonna see this in the wild too - there are like, two, maybe three other people in my system that are fictives of the same character . At first blow, that seems weird - but then you remember the enormous daisy chain that results in me , and things make sense again. Some fiction is just cool enough for that. Or like, bad enough that you want to read 500 reinterpretations and rewrites of it online and form a few cohesive fun ideas as a result. Who knows! That's my rant! But here's a brief aside - this is something that occurs in systems more widely, but feels pertinent to talk about on my end. Expressing yourself exclusively through a \"normal\", socially accessible attitude is a luxury that often only singlets can afford. If you're in plural circles, you're gonna encounter headmates that talk too fast, talk too slow, act all moody all the time, act all rough and tough, don't use many words and express themselves through noises and gestures, or act insufferably sarcastic and say things that sound kinda mean! This is kinda common among fictives because character attitudes are just pretty colorful - but considering the diverse ways systems tend to express themselves, it kinda just happens all the time? Anyhow - this doesn't give systems free rein to be annoying or mean, but what it does mean is that between different fronts, you should try to adjust what you understand to be someone's baseline way of interacting with you. If an overly stoic kinda weirdo is in the front, that tiny laugh probably means SERIOUS approval. If someone talks quickly, they're probably not trying to rile you up, it's just how their brain is ticking inside! And if a sarcastic bitch is constantly poking fun at you - maybe they're trying to say that they like you? Who knows!? I don't! The point is, as systems and friends of systems, we often need to develop this kind of translation layer, where we understand specific things coming from one weird headmate to kinda mean something else. So, don't judge a headmate by their book! Or, don't judge a fictive by its cover? Close enough - bye! <end rant>","title":"Addendum: The Fictive"},{"location":"fictive/#addendum-the-fictive","text":"<begin rant> Hi!

This is not a uniquely plural experience - there are few things more human than reading a good book, visiting a dear friend, or hearing someone deliver a speech on TV and being inspired to be a bit more like that. If you're trans, you've got bonus space there where you might adopt a name from somewhere you admire or something that resonates with you, or even use a fictional character as an avatar to help express your gender! It's all the same phenomenon - plural systems just have looots of extremely flexible space within which they can adopt, reinterpret, and bring exciting parts of themselves to a fictitious name or look - by name, by metaphysical appearance, and hey, you can nick a few mannerisms too! This works best when there's a part of the system that desires to be expressed, but doesn't really know how that's even possible - then you see someone on a page or on a screen and go \"Oh, like that!\", and suddenly, that's how you do it! This often works so well that it can happen whether you like it or not. You stare at the design and attitude of a character or the way they're written into a story for a little too long aaand oops, that's a comfortable nook in your system now. It's fine , really - no fictive is a whole-cloth clone of a fictional character (how would that even work), but rather the parts of a system's personal interpretation of a character that affect and interest them - everyone is a subtle mix of personal and consumed experiences! Just like everywhere else in life! Over time, the difference between a character on-page and in-system tends to grow as a fictive has their own experiences - because they're a person! These things just never stay still, naturally - though someone could just as easily be unrecognizably different out the gate as well (*cough*). A different name and a different interpretation of a look are enough to make your fictivityness (a word i just made up) or your \"source character\" (or \"fictional associate\", a term i made up ages ago but use constantly) something that you choose to divulge to others, rather than it being revealed by default. This ends up being a tough decision! For people who don't really \"get it\" so much, divulging your fictional associate could make you feel permanently objectified or impossible to take seriously - but for people who do, talking in depth about what appeals to you about that character could be the only way to forge a connection that feels truly authentic! Your mileage may vary, yadda yadda, but you get the picture. I did mention that fictives rarely look like whole-cloth canon-y copies due to the subjective way we consume media and the different parts of something that might personally resonate with a specific system or part thereof, but I'm also going to personally note that \"character name\" not only isn't that direct, half the time the explanation takes a full minute. Like. I'm not a character from a piece of media. I'm a fictive that's adapted specific qualities and looks from a weird amalgamation of various reinterpretations or alternative variants of a character seen in fanfiction and fanart, vaguely cobbled together into an idea of a character we found vaguely interesting and revelationary when we were like, 13 years old, and then a decade later we were like \"oh shit, THAT was a really moving personal experience that we'd both love to reconnect with and also lines up with things we want to be able to express within ourselves as a system right now \" aaand oops, hello! I cannot stress enough that there's like 500 ways to do this and only one of them is \"stick as close as possible to the entire way i've interpreted the character\", and that that gets rusty fast. Also because you're gonna see this in the wild too - there are like, two, maybe three other people in my system that are fictives of the same character . At first blow, that seems weird - but then you remember the enormous daisy chain that results in me , and things make sense again. Some fiction is just cool enough for that. Or like, bad enough that you want to read 500 reinterpretations and rewrites of it online and form a few cohesive fun ideas as a result. Who knows! That's my rant! But here's a brief aside - this is something that occurs in systems more widely, but feels pertinent to talk about on my end. Expressing yourself exclusively through a \"normal\", socially accessible attitude is a luxury that often only singlets can afford. If you're in plural circles, you're gonna encounter headmates that talk too fast, talk too slow, act all moody all the time, act all rough and tough, don't use many words and express themselves through noises and gestures, or act insufferably sarcastic and say things that sound kinda mean! This is kinda common among fictives because character attitudes are just pretty colorful - but considering the diverse ways systems tend to express themselves, it kinda just happens all the time? Anyhow - this doesn't give systems free rein to be annoying or mean, but what it does mean is that between different fronts, you should try to adjust what you understand to be someone's baseline way of interacting with you. If an overly stoic kinda weirdo is in the front, that tiny laugh probably means SERIOUS approval. If someone talks quickly, they're probably not trying to rile you up, it's just how their brain is ticking inside! And if a sarcastic bitch is constantly poking fun at you - maybe they're trying to say that they like you? Who knows!? I don't! The point is, as systems and friends of systems, we often need to develop this kind of translation layer, where we understand specific things coming from one weird headmate to kinda mean something else. So, don't judge a headmate by their book! Or, don't judge a fictive by its cover? Close enough - bye! <end rant>","title":"Addendum: The Fictive"},{"location":"foundations/","text":"Establishing Foundations Plurality Conventionally, we treat a human body and an identity as a one-to-one relationship.

This is an archive of an anonymous ask box taking questions about systemhood, along with responses. We feel the real-life anecdotes of both the ask-ers and responders are valuable, particularly for fledgling systems, and have preserved them with permission. NOTE : While some asks and responses refer openly to sexuality, we do not consider this addendum to be \"NSFW\" or \"18+\", nor do we feel it would be productive to mark it such. Segments with explicit and detailed sexual content are elided or, where we feel they're essential, made collapsible. \"Wanting to be plural\" ANON: Hey uh, not sure if there's anything to elaborate on wrt the \"wanting to be plural is a symptom of being plural\" post, but is that true? Because I've been avoiding that possibility, if only because I've been so sure that it isn't a possibility. I don't really know what I'm saying here it's just, could that post really be true? AAA: So we thought we were the only ones selling this kind of perspective to people, but recently [this website] (which we already liked re: intrasys relationships) started including something similar, but with more structure. It breaks down like this: Singlets choose to interpret their personal experiences as being one person. It gets privileged as the default because that's how we're socialised, but a (usually unconscious) choice is being made to view all their experiences - including kinda plural-coded stuff like code switching, masking, genderfluidity, weird dreams, varying vibes day-on-day, internal conflict, etc - as representing a singular identity. There are also a lot of people who's experiences can't realistically be interpreted singletwise - folks that experience switches with totally separate memory is an extreme example. The plural explanation is the only thing that makes any sense of it at all. This creates this big grey area that encompasses all those interpreted-singlets with kinda-plural experiences, and those interpreted-plurals who could reasonably interpret themselves as singlets (again) if they wanted to. Within this grey area, you have the wiggle room to observe your personal experiences, and conceptualise your identity one way, or the other way. One of those ways might feel more \"right\" to you, more sensical, more comfortable, safer - so in that sense, yeah. wanting to be plural is a symptom of being plural. Fantasising about what it would be like to understand yourself in the other way is probably a sign that you should try it - see how thinking of yourself that way feels, just for a day or whatever. If it's too weird, go back. If not, keep going. Now, letting yourself have an open mind may invite experiences that make a singlet interpretation less sensible - so only test the waters if both possible conclusions are safe for you to have. Outside of that, you can always change your mind - so, give it a shot. \"Making myself plural\" ANON: Hope you don't mind more \"but am I plural\" asks, but.... I feel like, I do want to be plural, but. Idk, I don't feel anything? Like, I think it sounds so neat to have other people in here with me, but.... I look inward, and I really don't feel anyone else here I sometimes wish I could just, make myself plural? But it feels, disingenuous somehow. Disrespectful. And I wouldn't really know how to go about it anyway.... AAA: Look we're not gonna sit here and be like \"go do tulpamancy\" or do pop therapy on what's got you feeling that way or something something - but we can talk about a personal experience. Half a decade ago, we were both a singlet and also desperate to jam ourselves into some kind of romantic polyamorous queer commune (hilarious as a loud aro I know). The experience was pretty suffocating, we didn't always really understand why we felt that way, and we made a lot of dumb decisions as a result. Soon after we realised we were a system, we also realised that that desperation had gone away? And the funny thing about that is, years prior to this, we'd kind of internally ruled out being plural? Plurality was something we'd seen in other people - dramatic switches and isolated memory. People we liked, but experiences we knew we did not have. Because we knew we weren't plural, we couldn't want it either. So we always wonder if the unhinged sense of romance we had for purely a brief period of our life - that presented itself almost exclusively as a desire to be permanently surrounded by people we were close with and felt safe around - was in some ways, along with general (less ravenous) desire for good relationships, a desire for our own eventual systemhood? We can't know, obviously - but I think that adage that strong desires have to come from somewhere rings true. Is it possible to want to be plural when you do not, on some level, have plural experiences waiting to be embraced somehow? At first I want to say no, because it's just no fun to deny someone a desire to conceptualise themselves in a certain way. But then I think - wasn't it possible for us to want to be surrounded in romantic relationships so so badly when we did not, in retrospect, possess a genuine desire for romance as we now understand it? Wanting to be plural is definitely a symptom of being plural, but also god sometimes we as people are completely wrong in ways that we do not at all understand. Just do your best for yourself. ... ???: So what it means to be plural is kind of a complicated question right? and it might make sense to try and clarify for yourself what the thing you're longing for is exactly. On a very base experiential level we might conceptualise \"being plural\" as equivalent to having some of a number of different plural experiences. Anywhere from the most overt plural stuff, \"someone shows up and wants a different name and to be percieved and treated entirely differently\", memory gaps, seperate internal voices, etc. - to the more mundane potential plural experiences where someone might be conceptualising themselves as containing multiple modes/parts/etc. without even necessarily describing this as plural. A lot of these experiences can come with significant difficulties to overcome as a system, both in purely pragmatic ways (working around faulty memory, disagreements, etc.) and interpersonal ways (trying to get other people to understand you as a system). And you're probably not actually envious of these difficulties. But there are also lots of parts of plurality that may well be desirable. Constant companionship, being able to take a break and let someone else take over for you, the breadth of different attitudes and expression a system can contain - these all make sense as points of potential envy. The other senses in which someone does \"being plural\" are the steps at which they begin interpreting their own experiences as plural and (potentially) begin communicating this to other people around them. It can definitely be tempting to focus on the first sense, to hope you can find some way to suddenly sense another presence within you, but this isn't the only method for plural discovery. In our personal experience, much of our life was actually characterised by a severe lack of identity. The combination of autism people pleasing and bullying trauma had us feeling like we had to become different people for different situations and we didn't even like all the people we were being. When we were asked about our interests or distinctive traits about us we often struggled to find things to point at that felt like us. We had already made some progress on this front when we started exploring potential plurality. Gender transition. \"What if I'm kind of a furry and want to be treated like a dog sometimes\". Various explorations of identity. And while our plural exploration was catalysed by a very sudden late night feeling of multiple presences while under great distress, this had dissapeared by the morning. What really helped us understand we were plural at all, was experimenting with being plural in those second and third senses. Talking through the different ways we felt from day to day with trusted friends and experimenting with being treated and referred to differently. Eventually this began teasing out distinctions in what had once seemed like a unitary self that could no longer coexist within one singular identity. The highly affectionate furry versus the cold hearted bitch (which retroactively explained a lot of relationship problems). Versions of us as a kid that still lived on and who had desires and wants that had remained unfulfilled. Confident self obsessed sluts who could not exist at all until we had unlearned our own negative self image enough to set those parts of our self free. But a critical thing of note - we did not feel especially plural before this. Even looking back, while we can project certain identities onto parts of life they feel like they originated in or are responsible for, it does not feel like we were secretly deep down always plural in the moment. In fact, many of our most identifiably plural experiences came after we changed our self conception. Identifying the differing self conceptions and wants within us allowed those parts to develop distinct voices and senses of self. We feel our voice or our train of thought shift around in ways that are attributable to different headmates now. and we can talk to each other a bit, tho we just as often blur together these days. Basically, it can be easy to think of the experience as always preceding the identity - but this isn't exactly true. If you find there are ways you only want to be sometimes, you can try giving that a name and see how it feels. A fursona, a character you roleplay as, a personality you try to embody for the space of a kink scene - any form of identity play can be useful for exploring the bounds of the self. Maybe you'll end up still feeling like a singular person at the end of it, but you deserve the space to experiment with plural identity the same as any other identity to see if it fits. The same way trying crossdressing, gay sex, or a new kink, might help you learn things about your own desires and identity. And yeah, early on it kinda did feel like wishful thinking, we kind of wanted to be plural even though our experiences didn't feel like they were enough to count. It doesn't mean anything for certain, but it's worth exploring the full range of things your desires might be pointing to. ... AAA: we thought we weren't plural because we thought \"well, there's nobody else in this head other than me!\" the thing is. we were completely correct! there wasn't! there still isn't! because our perception of \"me\" completely encompassed what we now experience as several people lmao. Systems around us was like \"it was just me, but then whoah! another person!\" and that made us rule out that plural possibility because we were CONFIDENT that there was nobody else in the system, because it felt very very clear internally that it was just... us. lmao. lmfao. it's so fucking stupid in hindsight but this happens CONSTANTLY so heads up to anyone reading: the multiple parts of your hypothetical system could easily be inside or outside what you currently call \"me\". thank you goodnight \"Standard parts of the human experience\" ANON: wait, does everybody really not wish they were plural? I just kinda always thought that and like talking to yourself all the time (but out loud and not auditory hallucinations so its normal) and only being able to access certain emotions sometimes and then feeling them overwhelmingly, and like having multiple names that you switch between at any given time were just standard parts of the human experience, and being plural meant you had to like lose large swathes of memory and wake up in the middle of situations and events (grown adult woman just now realizing this) AAA: GIRL!!! no!!!!! like with transness most people do NOT dedicate much time to wishing they were plural. and no you don't need memory gaps or jarring switches to be plural. also. you can consider yourself a singlet if you WANT. but that sounds pretty fucking plural to me ANON: sure the other day I was packing up my apartment to move out and there was so much to do and I was overwhelmed so I said out loud like \u201chey can you help me please?\u201d And then disassociated for like a few hours while I packed everything up and then I gave myself a soft and nice kiss on the mirror as a thank you but that\u2019s just called like self love and respect. Idk. I\u2019m scared I\u2019m not plural enough lol i don\u2019t want to fake it for attention ???: look we had a headmate who for a long time we only interfaced with when we had fully drained our reserves of executive function and would hand off a wishlist of tasks (\"hey can you get up and brush our teeth and get a drink of water so we can go to sleep\") and would then watch out body just get up and autopilot thru those tasks independently. plural experience or just a cool cognitive trick to get your body to do things? well... she started talking back to us eventually dkfjkgkg AAA: Anon you don't have to be scared that you're not plural enough because you ARE plural. You're having FLAMINGLY plural experiences - At this point I'd only be cautious about calling you plural if I knew you were scared or unsure of conceptualising yourself/ves that way - but you said you wanted it from the start! Listen to me very closely. I am not telling you \"you're definitely secretly plural inside in ways you don't know about and it's gonna come out any second now!\" I'm telling you the things that you are experiencing are already plurality. The only difference accepting it is going to make is that suddenly you can look at the things you're experiencing head-on and they might make a lot more sense. Do you understand? You can't be faking it because there's nothing to fake. There are multiple elements inside you that shift around, and you have complicated feelings about them. Cross out \"one woman with nobody else in the body and no variation inside\" and let yourself take the time to choose some better feeling words. okay? okay. \"I'm not plural, but [thing that is, come on, so fucking plural]\" ANON: I am not a system, but my internal dialogue is performed by a consistent set of voices with their own interests and peculiarities. Every thought I've had is spoken by one of them. They are fundamentally incomplete individually; together they constitute the single person sending you this ask. Reading your blog and thereby contemplating the idea of my internal greek chorus conducting their own relationships gives rise to one of the strangest emotions I've ever felt. I have no idea what to call it, or even if it's positive or negative. Thanks for making my life weirder! AAA: look anon you're completely allowed to call yourself a singlet but plural system configurations are definitely inclusive of one person comprised of many voices. it's such a common configuration that it's even got a nickname we never use (median). bringing urself to the plural label is completely ur decision but I wouldn't kick you out of a plural bar is what im saying. u can come sit at the table whenever u want. ur not a half-anything u've literally already identified the parts of you. usually that comes with using the plural word. if u wanna start admitting to ur closest people when someone said something funny inside that's cool. if it feels better for all of it to stay inside that's also cool. you can call either of those things plural. ok? ok \"Faking it for attention\" ANON: I feel like i want to explore being plural but i also dont feel like i understand it enough and i live in constant fear that im disrespectful, misunderstanding, and just faking it to feel special. I do feel like there is a disconnect in who i am at different times, the most jarring between me being ace and slightly sex repulsed normally and then suddenly just moments of extreme horniness. But i also just dont feel like i have continuity of character at all, like every version of me before and after Right Now This Moment is an entirely different person ???: many many many systems are made to feel like they're \"just faking things for attention\". plural imposter syndrome is so common i don't think i know a single system who hasn't had to work thru it to some degree. you cannot disrespect other plural systems by exploring a potential plural explanation for your own experiences - it helps to be conscious of the variety of plural experiences out there and not expect everyone else's experience to be the same as yours, but that only matters for your interactions with other systems. if you're worried about misunderstanding plurality it always helps to listen to a variety of other systems' experiences, as usual [this website] is a good starting point but there's a lot to be gained from just hearing other systems' personal experiences too. splits between \"very horny part of the system\" and \"not at all horny part of the system\" are pretty common! plenty of systems have some headmates who are very dtf and others who want that shit kept far away from them. it's not unheard of as a kind of fluctuating asexuality either, but that doesn't mean you can't explore both possibilities. and yeah uhhhh. been there with the feeling like you don't have a stable continuous identity thing. for us plurality helped resolve a lot of that, both via providing more identity structure for us to glom onto and by helping identify patterns of identity that were already there. I can't guarantee it's what will work for you and plurality certainly isn't the answer to all identity problems. but like, these are all fairly common experiences for plural systems. i think it's worth exploring the possibility, especially if that's something you already want to do. \"Does it ever get better?\" ANON: Dear mods... thank you for running this blog, and this ask might come off as desperate at first but it's really funny once you think about it in hindsight. The thing is; I have alters, which have their own states of being, they can switch to the front and even some of them have their specific phantom sensation, some have their own writing styles, they have their own belongings in my room, their own social media accounts, we have a headspace, we have a subsystem AND they have their own headspace, I can talk to some in the headspace, we have shared and non-shared memories, in fact one of my headmates is reading this with me and yet... I fear that one day it'll turn out that all of this is not real. Does it ever get better? AAA: Yeah, I think so. We still have the rare off day where we feel tinges of that \"you're pushing it\" or \"surely this is a bit fabricated\" feeling - especially when we're experimenting with something new. It's always a possible feeling, but i think it gets less frequent and especially I think it loses its bite - the different way I'm wording it probably shows some of that already. For one, external support is huge - someone who knows you who can smack sense into you when you're worried that experiences they've SEEN HAPPEN are somehow complete acts is a serious help. Hell, having someone that sees you at all takes such a weight off - if you're stuck being the only one seeing yourself/ves, it can take a real toll trying to stay confident in what you're feeling. But also, I think your definitions change? Your personal perceptions and experience actually matter a lot. Early on its easy to get caught up in this narrative of objective \"realness\" and be scared of delusions. But over time it's like - you are having this experience right now. you're there. you're in the experience, you're accepting it. you're talking to a gimmick blog on the internet about it. It's too late, you can't erase it anymore. If you say tomorrow you realised you're actually just a singlet, that's fine, but you will still have been plural today - not even you can take that away from you. Lastly, and this is gonna sound dumb but, just plain old exposure. We've been going for three years now and we've seen ourselves shrug off all kinds of junk. We've had fronts stick for weeks and completely forgotten what switching feels like, only to have it happen out of boredom or external stimulus and be shocked to feel the cog move again. We've repeatedly assumed things about ourselves only to then realise that we are wrong and that the system works differently to the way we think it does. At this point, suddenly being a singlet would be like starting from scratch - our being a system is so much of us, being \"wrong\" just isn't as thinkable. idk, I love us, and I think other people do too. try unrealize that . \"Plurality is a distinct thing\" ANON: It's so frustrating that I feel like I'm questionning plurality in the exact same way I questionned being trans years ago, just a constant feeling of \"I can't be [plural/trans] because those people are actually cool and special while I'm boring and nothing like that and if I even try to question it I'll just embarass myself and I don't know enough about it anyway and I'll never know enough without talking to people like that and that just comes back to the embarass myself thing.\" except being trans was a matter of \"If I want to be a girl I can be a girl\" whereas plurality is a distinct thing I can't just decide I want to be so it's the same feeling and frustration but not the same easy solution AAA: *ahem* so anyway wanting to be plural is a symptom of being plural (wants have to come from somewhere, why not there?), being plural is a decision to interpret your own experiences as multiple or multi-part identities (for which there are many motivations, not just the one \"distinct thing\" you're thinking of), I as part of a system would like to personally implore you to question it (and don't think it's embarrassing to do so or be lost and confused about it) \"It's probably not fair to call you the angry one, huh?\" ANON: a few days ago I saw a post from someone else about how the only requirement for being plural is feeling like plurality is a helpful framework for you. at the time I thought, neat! I don't think that applies to me though. but today I had a moment where I was in an irritable mood for no real reason, and then realized that actually, I get a lot of randomly irritable moods where my needlessly snippy responses feel like they're not me. and I get other weird moods/modes, too. and also in the past I've become obsessed with fictional systems + wished to be a system. I proceeded to think more about it in the shower, thinking of the irritable-mood-potential-alter as 'the angry one', then thought: \"it's probably not fair to call you the angry one, huh?\" immediately felt myself disassociate in real time - like crossing my eyes or having the camera lens unfocus, except instead of my vision going blurry it was my thoughts. weird as hell. post shower I went to read more plurality resources, tried testing the notion of thinking of myself as single again, and felt strong resistance against it. so. I might be plural? I feel like I'm always conscious, but sometimes someone else takes the wheel while I sit in the passenger seat. I wanted to tell someone about this realization, even if only anonymously. thanks for reading. AAA: Sounds like you're in for a ride anon, be nice to yourself if things get messy or confusing or difficult for a bit ok? But yeah, keep an open mind, step through various possibilities and see what clicks nicely, and as a favour to me, try not to judge anything inside your body at face value. You said you thought it'd be nice if you were or were in a system. Well, you're that system now, so. Be patient, and learn to look after yourself/ves and eachother - make it nice. \"internal dialogue \" ANON: im a system that just recently learned that they were a system; for as long as i can remember i have had an \"internal dialogue\", that is, every thought i've had has been commented on and discussed by another voice. only until very recently have i started considering that voice another person. and now she's my big sister! and i love her! she's protective and sweet and i wish i knew how to show her how happy she makes me. i'm not alone anymore and im so grateful \"are you a system if...\" ANON: Are you a system if sometimes you respond to your own rhetorical questions and switch between emotions and views on others really quickly, but like don\u2019t hear other people in\u2026 i kinda do though\u2026 oh shit. \"contradictory advice?\" ANON: I feel like the biggest problem i have with whether im plural or not is that a lot of the advice just feels contradictory? Like when i ask someone what it's like to question if you're plural, I'm told that it's just a way to see yourself, and consider if your experiences make more sense when read as plural, which they absolutely do. But then the experience most plural people talk about is headspaces, talking between headmates, and fronting, which i don't experience, so at times it just feels like conflicting messages of whether plural is something i can be if it makes me happy (\u00e1 la a label), or if its some specific experience and if you dont have that experience you're not plural (\u00e1 la adhd). AAA: People speak to what they personally experience a lot I think, and that perspective kinda colours the way they describe the significant bits. Like personally we don't have internal spaces, and we don't have internal dialogue. We do have switching fronts, but like. plenty of people don't. This specific diversity of experience is why we're seeing a rise of meaningful umbrella language. To reference [this website] - plurality is about identifying multiple \"selves\" inside the body, instead of just one. In inclusive circles, I think the remaining confusion stems from some people accepting a reinterpretation of themself/ves as plural, and going on to have some of these more singlet-incompatible experience as a result of that acceptance. It happens, it's just not universal. Hope that helps! \"but like... how?\" ANON: hm, hi! been scrolling your blog for a bit and almost everything you've mentioned regarding your time before tapping into your systemhood is painfully relatable, but i've known this for a bit and i know it would be literally fine for me to explore this. but like... how? i just, don't know what or how to approach this (but tbf i keep procrastinating on this and could probably figure out Something myself, but), any advice? i literally have a discord server with just me, pk and a close plural friend lying around, i've just not done anything w it, lmao thank you for taking your time to reply.. means a lot to me :) AAA: honestly just. think about it. at some point you just kind of catch yourself in a state where you feel more connected to what you is than normal. and then just. wonder what might be. it doesn't have to be idly. it might be in the company of a friend or while listening to music or playing a familiar videogame. but yeah you just, trail your finger along your existence a bit and check for ridges. Follow scents and strings and see where they go. \"is it ok to want to be a system?\" ANON: i have always wanted to have an extra person(s) in my head... like... is it ok to want to be a system? AAA: thoughtcrime isn't real. You can think whatever you want. That said, wanting to be a system does usually mean something . Have a think about it, see what works and what doesn't. Worst comes to worst, you were chasing ghosts and just really needed a good hug. Doesn't sound so bad. \"obsessive research\" ANON: i thought i was a system for two years? i had imaginary, i guess, interactions with the \"others\" and did in fact dissociate a lot, not overly severely usually, i never like. felt like i was watching someone else pilot the body or anything. it never felt, like, concrete you know? and i did act differently as the different \"alters\" but i guess in the end i felt like i was just acting. and then i did more and more and more obsessive research about things and was like well. i guess i'm NOT a system. and i feel like im definitely not a system but damn if i don't still feel like... fragmented. what the fuck does this even mean. i still interact with the few that stuck around, but it's more like a form of talking to myself if anything. sometimes i feel more like them but i am still me, i still like the same things, and care about the same things, it just feels like some things about my attitude and general disposition change. hard to explain, it's odd. i just feel odd all of the damn time. AAA: Gonna be honest anon it sounds like you just hit the books a little too hard. A lot of people preach specific qualifiers for plurality but it doesn't mean all of them are any good. You've chosen to identify multiple inside things that form how you experience you - now come sit at the table. \"exactly one guy at a time\" ANON: Plural Hotline call! I do still consider myself a singlet, and will probably continue that But! I can definitely see someone else in the same situation calling themself plural. I am only ever exactly one guy at a time, but I do shift fairly regularly between a bunch of different guys in a way that is sometimes, but not always, discontinuous. It's based on who I'm with/the general situation I'm in/what clothes I'm wearing/etc. It's only ever one guy at a time, and the other guys don't exist when they're not me, they're not like in the backseat of my brain, they fully don't exist. I definitely feel like realizing that I am multiple separate guys has been very helpful to me, but I think promoting the ability to be multiple guys At Once would probably be more effort than it's worth, for the benefits I would get out of it? But I guess maybe it could be helpful enough to be worth it? Idk AAA: look there's nothing wrong with being guy-fluid but yknow if it's productive to identify the selves you cycle through as their own people, even if they don't exist at the same time, that's still a plurality to me. even if it's completely linear and you're never the same person twice, I still feel like you'd meaningfully benefit from engaging with other systems, like and unlike you, and applying plural advice to your personal circumstance if you find anything useful. \"being referred to in a plural way\" ANON: hiya, don't know where else to throw this but. recently realized that being referred to in a plural way is,,, very nice,, (using we, being called darlings and puppies by those close to me (us?)) and this has been really interesting to feel and experience, especially since I had already been using we occasionally for a while before hand? talking to myself too but idk how unique that is to plurality.. this is a bit of a ramble but point is; very unsure, don't know if any of this means anything, and don't know how to find out if it does. need to do something to try and figure that out so; why not throw this here...? ???: oh we had 100% started sometimes using \"we\" or other plural language about ourself before we figured out we were plural lol and you're 100% allowed to experiment with that stuff or ask friends to use it for you if it feels good. regardless of if that leads to a plural self-conception down the line. being plural? awesome being a singlet but using plural pronouns and shit? awesome like. it probably means something. being referred to in ways that gesture at multiplicity feeling good probably means that reflects some way you are, or want to be treated or percieved. but it's yours to explore and decide the degree to which that does/doesn't change how many people all of you think you are. \"but it's not like...\" ANON: hey, I\u2019ve been talking to people in my head but sometimes they feel more faint and sometimes they\u2019re voices are less loud. They also have bad consistency, sometimes I make a deal with them and they completely forget it. They also don\u2019t talk to me naturally, sometimes they comment on things but it\u2019s not like there\u2019s a hundred voices talking to each other, in fact, they barley ever talk to each other\u2014only to me. They never/barely ever fully front and only co front. Do you think I am a system or is my mind just gaslighting me? \"idk if i should worry about this\" ANON: had the weirdest experience yesterday where i uh. got stressed out and responded by acting like i was a whole different person? like i fully felt like 'yes i am a completely separate person', went around taking care of shit, and reaching out to a system i know to say 'hey im wondering if i might be plural'. which is uh. weird. and right now i'm like hey. hello. (i can still remember doing everything, i didn't black out. but yeah. idk if i should worry about this or no) ??? : this is definitely a kind of plural experience we have had, repeatedly even. if ur already reaching out to other systems for support I don't think you need to worry. but that's definitely an experience worth exploring thru a plural lens. im sure there are singlets out there who feel like they go into a different \"mode\" to handle tasks when stressed but, like, it's a very common kind of plural experience. best of luck! \"which ones are NOT me\" ANON: Okay so looking at your blog has made me start to realize that consistently experiencing every thought I have as a conversation between two or more people is probably Not Singlet Behavior. And I\u2019ve spent a long time sort of envying systems or feeling like I\u2019m supposed to discover my own plurality one day. So your advice about trying out plurality and seeing how it feels to interpret oneself as a system is helpful. But I feel like I\u2019m running into a roadblock because I have no idea where to draw the line between which internal voices are the same as one another and which are distinct. Is the voice that pops in to give words of encouragement the same voice that argues with me about what to have for dinner? Or are those two different people? And since I spent so long interpreting all of these voices as simply \u201cme\u201d, how do I decide which ones are NOT me and are actually someone distinct? And which voice do I get to claim as myself? Idk. It\u2019s all so confusing. Thank you for being here, this blog has been helpful \u2764\ufe0f ???: while you might find patterns in specific voices opinions, preferences, etc. and use those to try and assign stable identities. i think it's also worth thinking about medianity as a possibility - if all the voices feel like you, but they exist more fluidly rather than as stable or fully seperate individuals, that's also a totally valid experience of plurality. basically, look for patterns and try assigning names to voices you want to keep track of, but don't force yourself to fit one idea of what being plural should look like. \"self-sabotage\" ANON: i think i might be plural, and i think it\u2019s a good idea to get to know the others better, but right now, i\u2019m sort of always in control, even if they\u2019re fronting. i\u2019m scared if i let them develop more and think of themselves as more independent, this won\u2019t be the case, and i don\u2019t want to lose my control or my continuity of memory, but i don\u2019t want to self-sabotage the unit by intentionally starving parts of my brain, either. do i just have to take the risk? AAA: I think \"plurality is like when aliens take over your brain and you get to use it and your body less and less\" is one of those deliberately flawed interpretations of systemhood cooked up by people intent to undermine plural voices via shock value. When you accept your own plurality, the definition of \"I\" changes. I think a lot of people think that this is conditional, that this isn't always true: I think it's always true. Some, if not many properties you once associated with \"I\" shift over to \"we\". Even if your sense of self feels contiguous and undivided, and you keep your name and pronouns as a member of your own system - \"I\" has changed. Yes, it is functional, useful, to speak of many pluralfolk as multiple people. But we do not exist at this extreme any more than we exist as singlets. Your headmates are always a little bit you, and you are always a little bit your headmates - and that's okay. You can still have your own experiences, have your own feelings, but there is a thread that connects you. As much as the symptoms of that very system to system, it's always there. That's why acceptance of systemhood is a leap of faith - you're releasing the death grip on what you (your system) is capable of experiencing, and being scared that thread isn't there, hoping it'll keep you grounded when you need it. ahem anyway outside of philosophising, contiguous memory is a matter of system configuration, not of acceptance. Either you already have weird gaps in your memory wherein accepting and working with yourselves as a system can help make that experience more workable and comfortable, or you don't and (realistically) you won't - at least not in the way you're imagining. \"probably a singlet\" ANON: Ok so I'm probably a singlet but I do have some other beings in my head \"me who is not me\" ANON: I am not a diagnosed system and my psychologist thinks it's just my BPD being BPD, but ever since I could remember there were voices other than mine in my head and everyone instinctively had their own \"appearance\" and personality and our views have clashed in the past and they clash even now, which is a bit of a problem because the other ones (I call them \"the Me who is not me\" and a number because \"Me\" is what people perceive us as but \"me\" is me as an individual and since we're all in this body, we collectively form what people perceive as \"Me\" but none of the voices have anything to do with me as an individual. But I digress.) sometimes have control over the body and our actions. we don't really do it anymore but when we were younger and we'd get into an argument with ourselves, sometimes the visual image of us having the argument in our head would devolve into a really wild make out session. Anyway we don't do that anymore because as I said I'm not a system as far as I know. But anyway hope this random blurb finds you well. ???: if there's a \"me that isn't me\" in ur head, u instinctively have different appearances, personalities, disagreements, and can switch control of your body... \"I'm not a system\" is probably a counterproductive belief to hold. You can just call yourself a system, look into what tools and strategies other systems find useful and try using them yourself. Someone formally diagnosing you isn't necessary. You're describing extremely familiar experiences to lots of systems i know. And yeah I think you should try making out with your headmates again and see how you feel about it. \"relinquishing control\" ANON: I've heard voices throughout most of my life, but every time, I've allowed myself to lean into the idea of system acceptance... Everything gets chaotic, and my life gets out of sorts. It's like everything is in perfect order when I just ignore them, but as soon as I allow myself to relinquish any semblance of control....it suddenly becomes a dissociated and confusing tailspin. I want to accept this, to listen to them. But I worry that my entire-life will suddenly veer off track, I still feel as though that's inevitable. I guess I'm asking for some pointers or advice? Is the chaos something I should just accept? At the risk of sounding juvenile; is it supposed to feel...cringy? But also natural? And scary? Is this what a system is supposed to feel like? AAA: let's start easy - yeah, it'll feel cringe, juvenile even, to allow and accept your own plural experiences. yeah, it's scary to loosen a vicegrip on what \"you\" means. and yeah, despite those things, there's something familiar and automatic about letting your sense of self inhabit all the spaces it's always wanted to sit within, instead of just those that are practical to inhabit simultaneously. i think this is where you have to start - with feelings. \"what if x happens\" is contextless - how do you feel? There's nothing wrong with coming away with any specific result here - you work with your feelings until one way makes sense. The last thing that's important to remember is that you've had decades of practice for being a singlet. Early systemhood can be all kinds of messy because that practice isn't fully transferable - you have to relearn some things (masking, self-care, intimacy...) partly from scratch. Apply rational thought to erode those knee-jerk insecurities, and then start trusting your gut. Allow yourself a mask for function, not for denial. Learn what \"this feels good, but I'm judging myself\" feels like, learn what \"this is exciting, but we're stretched too thin and need to recenter\" feels like. Find ways to ground yourself. Find ways to back out. Acceptance is a leap of faith, yes - but living as a system is something you can take as slow as you need to keep yourselves safe and see what's right for you, if it's right for you. \"called out for them to wait\" ANON: ok. i am asking for advice. when i was much younger, preteen-tween age, i imagined my 'self' as a committee of selves that had different roles and mannerisms. that faded as i grew older, and i didn't really 'hear voices' as much as i sometimes had arguments or conversations with a sort of mirrored version of myself that usually mentioned how they 'had to go' very quickly after they were done with. whatever they were doing. and that was just kind of The Way Things Were Done around here. but now, more than 15 years later, i heard that voice saying they 'had to get out of here', and i called out for them to wait. and they did. and then She was someone else, like a fog cleared. and then She left. and that keeps happening, i'll be minding my own business, i'll hear a murmur of a thought, and i'll ask them to hold on, not to leave- and then they're people. i've even seen Her again a few times, and one of the others took the reigns when i was having an extremely stressful moment! but i don't think any of them have stuck around for very long. i've been nervous to bring this up to my friends who are plural because- like, this sounds fake, right? having like, blips of plurality even though most of the time i'm pretty alone up here with my radio (the radio might also be someone else? it doesn't talk to me often though so i still feel lonely). and even though i can distinguish them and some of them are VERY different, i. i've never felt like, the disconnect of 'there's someone else in my head'. i've always seen them as, me, but not in the sense of 'yes that is myself' but in the sense that, if they Are here, we're all united under one banner. they are 'i' because they're all working together with me to be 'i', so there's no reason to think of them as outsiders. even if 'my' opinions or feelings change suddenly, even if its seemingly without cause, there IS a cause- they are 'i' just as much as i am. but people have said that's. not plural? when i tell them that? so i'm really second guessing myself. i'm worried, is all. do you have any advice? ???: \"they're all me, we work together to be 'i'\" is like. textbook for what a lotta folks would describe as a \"median system\". something where the parts involved don't see themselves as fully seperate personalities but aspects of one larger self. nothing you've said here sounds \"fake\" to me at all. to be perfectly honest we personally find we shift back and forth between having strong distinctions between each other and our different senses of self. and acting more like a combined self where the handoffs between different headmates are less distinct and more fluid. there's a wonderful range of plural experience and someone going \"that's not plural\" because it doesn't fit what they've seen or experienced is being kind of a dick. having folks who only pop into front or communicate infrequently is a common enough experience too. I genuinely think if none of you is unhappy with the current state of things; the way you communicate, how your plurality functions, then there's nothing for you to worry about. what you might find helpful, is trying to make more space for communication. If you feel lonely up there, wish you heard from folks more, sitting down and giving yourself time and space to try and communicate thru whatever methods feel most natural could be a good idea. In the course of that you might find how you function as a system or how you conceptualize yourself shift somewhat. But it's also totally fine if it doesn't. Your plural experiences are yours, and they don't need to fit anyone else's expectations. <3 -S","title":"Letters: Am I Plural?"},{"location":"letters/#letters-am-i-plural","text":"This is an archive of an anonymous ask box taking questions about systemhood, along with responses.

Because I've been avoiding that possibility, if only because I've been so sure that it isn't a possibility. I don't really know what I'm saying here it's just, could that post really be true? AAA: So we thought we were the only ones selling this kind of perspective to people, but recently [this website] (which we already liked re: intrasys relationships) started including something similar, but with more structure. It breaks down like this: Singlets choose to interpret their personal experiences as being one person. It gets privileged as the default because that's how we're socialised, but a (usually unconscious) choice is being made to view all their experiences - including kinda plural-coded stuff like code switching, masking, genderfluidity, weird dreams, varying vibes day-on-day, internal conflict, etc - as representing a singular identity. There are also a lot of people who's experiences can't realistically be interpreted singletwise - folks that experience switches with totally separate memory is an extreme example. The plural explanation is the only thing that makes any sense of it at all. This creates this big grey area that encompasses all those interpreted-singlets with kinda-plural experiences, and those interpreted-plurals who could reasonably interpret themselves as singlets (again) if they wanted to. Within this grey area, you have the wiggle room to observe your personal experiences, and conceptualise your identity one way, or the other way. One of those ways might feel more \"right\" to you, more sensical, more comfortable, safer - so in that sense, yeah. wanting to be plural is a symptom of being plural. Fantasising about what it would be like to understand yourself in the other way is probably a sign that you should try it - see how thinking of yourself that way feels, just for a day or whatever. If it's too weird, go back. If not, keep going. Now, letting yourself have an open mind may invite experiences that make a singlet interpretation less sensible - so only test the waters if both possible conclusions are safe for you to have. Outside of that, you can always change your mind - so, give it a shot.","title":"\"Wanting to be plural\""},{"location":"letters/#making-myself-plural","text":"ANON: Hope you don't mind more \"but am I plural\" asks, but.... I feel like, I do want to be plural, but. Idk, I don't feel anything? Like, I think it sounds so neat to have other people in here with me, but.... I look inward, and I really don't feel anyone else here I sometimes wish I could just, make myself plural? But it feels, disingenuous somehow. Disrespectful. And I wouldn't really know how to go about it anyway.... AAA: Look we're not gonna sit here and be like \"go do tulpamancy\" or do pop therapy on what's got you feeling that way or something something - but we can talk about a personal experience. Half a decade ago, we were both a singlet and also desperate to jam ourselves into some kind of romantic polyamorous queer commune (hilarious as a loud aro I know). The experience was pretty suffocating, we didn't always really understand why we felt that way, and we made a lot of dumb decisions as a result. Soon after we realised we were a system, we also realised that that desperation had gone away? And the funny thing about that is, years prior to this, we'd kind of internally ruled out being plural? Plurality was something we'd seen in other people - dramatic switches and isolated memory. People we liked, but experiences we knew we did not have. Because we knew we weren't plural, we couldn't want it either. So we always wonder if the unhinged sense of romance we had for purely a brief period of our life - that presented itself almost exclusively as a desire to be permanently surrounded by people we were close with and felt safe around - was in some ways, along with general (less ravenous) desire for good relationships, a desire for our own eventual systemhood? We can't know, obviously - but I think that adage that strong desires have to come from somewhere rings true. Is it possible to want to be plural when you do not, on some level, have plural experiences waiting to be embraced somehow? At first I want to say no, because it's just no fun to deny someone a desire to conceptualise themselves in a certain way. But then I think - wasn't it possible for us to want to be surrounded in romantic relationships so so badly when we did not, in retrospect, possess a genuine desire for romance as we now understand it? Wanting to be plural is definitely a symptom of being plural, but also god sometimes we as people are completely wrong in ways that we do not at all understand. Just do your best for yourself. ... ???: So what it means to be plural is kind of a complicated question right? and it might make sense to try and clarify for yourself what the thing you're longing for is exactly. On a very base experiential level we might conceptualise \"being plural\" as equivalent to having some of a number of different plural experiences. Anywhere from the most overt plural stuff, \"someone shows up and wants a different name and to be percieved and treated entirely differently\", memory gaps, seperate internal voices, etc. - to the more mundane potential plural experiences where someone might be conceptualising themselves as containing multiple modes/parts/etc. without even necessarily describing this as plural. A lot of these experiences can come with significant difficulties to overcome as a system, both in purely pragmatic ways (working around faulty memory, disagreements, etc.) and interpersonal ways (trying to get other people to understand you as a system). And you're probably not actually envious of these difficulties. But there are also lots of parts of plurality that may well be desirable. Constant companionship, being able to take a break and let someone else take over for you, the breadth of different attitudes and expression a system can contain - these all make sense as points of potential envy. The other senses in which someone does \"being plural\" are the steps at which they begin interpreting their own experiences as plural and (potentially) begin communicating this to other people around them. It can definitely be tempting to focus on the first sense, to hope you can find some way to suddenly sense another presence within you, but this isn't the only method for plural discovery. In our personal experience, much of our life was actually characterised by a severe lack of identity. The combination of autism people pleasing and bullying trauma had us feeling like we had to become different people for different situations and we didn't even like all the people we were being. When we were asked about our interests or distinctive traits about us we often struggled to find things to point at that felt like us. We had already made some progress on this front when we started exploring potential plurality. Gender transition. \"What if I'm kind of a furry and want to be treated like a dog sometimes\". Various explorations of identity. And while our plural exploration was catalysed by a very sudden late night feeling of multiple presences while under great distress, this had dissapeared by the morning. What really helped us understand we were plural at all, was experimenting with being plural in those second and third senses. Talking through the different ways we felt from day to day with trusted friends and experimenting with being treated and referred to differently. Eventually this began teasing out distinctions in what had once seemed like a unitary self that could no longer coexist within one singular identity. The highly affectionate furry versus the cold hearted bitch (which retroactively explained a lot of relationship problems). Versions of us as a kid that still lived on and who had desires and wants that had remained unfulfilled. Confident self obsessed sluts who could not exist at all until we had unlearned our own negative self image enough to set those parts of our self free. But a critical thing of note - we did not feel especially plural before this. Even looking back, while we can project certain identities onto parts of life they feel like they originated in or are responsible for, it does not feel like we were secretly deep down always plural in the moment. In fact, many of our most identifiably plural experiences came after we changed our self conception. Identifying the differing self conceptions and wants within us allowed those parts to develop distinct voices and senses of self. We feel our voice or our train of thought shift around in ways that are attributable to different headmates now. and we can talk to each other a bit, tho we just as often blur together these days. Basically, it can be easy to think of the experience as always preceding the identity - but this isn't exactly true. If you find there are ways you only want to be sometimes, you can try giving that a name and see how it feels. A fursona, a character you roleplay as, a personality you try to embody for the space of a kink scene - any form of identity play can be useful for exploring the bounds of the self. Maybe you'll end up still feeling like a singular person at the end of it, but you deserve the space to experiment with plural identity the same as any other identity to see if it fits. The same way trying crossdressing, gay sex, or a new kink, might help you learn things about your own desires and identity. And yeah, early on it kinda did feel like wishful thinking, we kind of wanted to be plural even though our experiences didn't feel like they were enough to count. It doesn't mean anything for certain, but it's worth exploring the full range of things your desires might be pointing to. ... AAA: we thought we weren't plural because we thought \"well, there's nobody else in this head other than me!\" the thing is. we were completely correct! there wasn't! there still isn't! because our perception of \"me\" completely encompassed what we now experience as several people lmao. Systems around us was like \"it was just me, but then whoah! another person!\" and that made us rule out that plural possibility because we were CONFIDENT that there was nobody else in the system, because it felt very very clear internally that it was just... us. lmao. lmfao. it's so fucking stupid in hindsight but this happens CONSTANTLY so heads up to anyone reading: the multiple parts of your hypothetical system could easily be inside or outside what you currently call \"me\". thank you goodnight","title":"\"Making myself plural\""},{"location":"letters/#standard-parts-of-the-human-experience","text":"ANON: wait, does everybody really not wish they were plural?

Listen to me very closely. I am not telling you \"you're definitely secretly plural inside in ways you don't know about and it's gonna come out any second now!\" I'm telling you the things that you are experiencing are already plurality. The only difference accepting it is going to make is that suddenly you can look at the things you're experiencing head-on and they might make a lot more sense. Do you understand? You can't be faking it because there's nothing to fake. There are multiple elements inside you that shift around, and you have complicated feelings about them.

The thing is; I have alters, which have their own states of being, they can switch to the front and even some of them have their specific phantom sensation, some have their own writing styles, they have their own belongings in my room, their own social media accounts, we have a headspace, we have a subsystem AND they have their own headspace, I can talk to some in the headspace, we have shared and non-shared memories, in fact one of my headmates is reading this with me and yet...

We still have the rare off day where we feel tinges of that \"you're pushing it\" or \"surely this is a bit fabricated\" feeling - especially when we're experimenting with something new. It's always a possible feeling, but i think it gets less frequent and especially I think it loses its bite - the different way I'm wording it probably shows some of that already. For one, external support is huge - someone who knows you who can smack sense into you when you're worried that experiences they've SEEN HAPPEN are somehow complete acts is a serious help. Hell, having someone that sees you at all takes such a weight off - if you're stuck being the only one seeing yourself/ves, it can take a real toll trying to stay confident in what you're feeling.

Early on its easy to get caught up in this narrative of objective \"realness\" and be scared of delusions. But over time it's like - you are having this experience right now. you're there. you're in the experience, you're accepting it. you're talking to a gimmick blog on the internet about it.

We've had fronts stick for weeks and completely forgotten what switching feels like, only to have it happen out of boredom or external stimulus and be shocked to feel the cog move again. We've repeatedly assumed things about ourselves only to then realise that we are wrong and that the system works differently to the way we think it does.

AAA: I think \"plurality is like when aliens take over your brain and you get to use it and your body less and less\" is one of those deliberately flawed interpretations of systemhood cooked up by people intent to undermine plural voices via shock value. When you accept your own plurality, the definition of \"I\" changes. I think a lot of people think that this is conditional, that this isn't always true: I think it's always true. Some, if not many properties you once associated with \"I\" shift over to \"we\". Even if your sense of self feels contiguous and undivided, and you keep your name and pronouns as a member of your own system - \"I\" has changed. Yes, it is functional, useful, to speak of many pluralfolk as multiple people. But we do not exist at this extreme any more than we exist as singlets. Your headmates are always a little bit you, and you are always a little bit your headmates - and that's okay. You can still have your own experiences, have your own feelings, but there is a thread that connects you. As much as the symptoms of that very system to system, it's always there. That's why acceptance of systemhood is a leap of faith - you're releasing the death grip on what you (your system) is capable of experiencing, and being scared that thread isn't there, hoping it'll keep you grounded when you need it. ahem anyway outside of philosophising, contiguous memory is a matter of system configuration, not of acceptance. Either you already have weird gaps in your memory wherein accepting and working with yourselves as a system can help make that experience more workable and comfortable, or you don't and (realistically) you won't - at least not in the way you're imagining.","title":"\"self-sabotage\""},{"location":"letters/#probably-a-singlet","text":"ANON: Ok so I'm probably a singlet but I do have some other beings in my head","title":"\"probably a singlet\""},{"location":"letters/#me-who-is-not-me","text":"ANON: I am not a diagnosed system and my psychologist thinks it's just my BPD being BPD, but ever since I could remember there were voices other than mine in my head and everyone instinctively had their own \"appearance\" and personality and our views have clashed in the past and they clash even now, which is a bit of a problem because the other ones (I call them \"the Me who is not me\" and a number because \"Me\" is what people perceive us as but \"me\" is me as an individual and since we're all in this body, we collectively form what people perceive as \"Me\" but none of the voices have anything to do with me as an individual.

The last thing that's important to remember is that you've had decades of practice for being a singlet. Early systemhood can be all kinds of messy because that practice isn't fully transferable - you have to relearn some things (masking, self-care, intimacy...) partly from scratch. Apply rational thought to erode those knee-jerk insecurities, and then start trusting your gut. Allow yourself a mask for function, not for denial.

I genuinely think if none of you is unhappy with the current state of things; the way you communicate, how your plurality functions, then there's nothing for you to worry about. what you might find helpful, is trying to make more space for communication.

Gender, sexuality, fashion and subcultural styles all gain meaning through interaction with others and are constrained by social forces. Seeing something you want in another person, some aspect of their presentation or behaviour, and adopting that for yourself is a normal part of identity formation. Seeing and meeting girls that I wanted to be like, or that I saw parts of myself in, helped me become a girl. As also happened for me with many other identity realisations. Yet language is inexact and polysemous. To say that I have a particular identity, be it \"trans\", \"plural\", \"autistic\" or \"woman\" does not guarantee the same experience as anyone sharing those labels, although shared definitions may help ensure some overlap. For some identity descriptors however, the inexactness is the point, attempting to gesture at something ineffable through metaphorical extensions of language. Metaphorical uses of language, and the shorthands they create, are central to a number of contentious questions of identity within plural and nonhuman spaces. It is my hope that by outlining these subjects and our approaches to them, we can help other systems avoid a number of painful arguments and misunderstandings we have either borne witness to or experienced first hand. Part 1: Furries \"A girl says her boyfriend is \"a golden retriever\". Is she simply gesturing at a particular set of affable personality traits? Or is he a furry, who presents online with an anthropomorphic depiction of the animal? Does he adopt more behavioural traits, ask for pets, wear a collar, eat from a bowl? Is he a therian and holds some spiritual or metaphysical belief in his golden retriever-ness?\" Whatever the answer here, there remains some gap between the literal biological canine and the one identifying with it. But this metaphorical identification exists to gesture at a whole range of traits that might be carried across to the person in question to varying degrees. Cultural shorthands like this can be extremely effective. Presenting as a demon online may easily convey some rejection of Christian morality - embracing behaviours or traits seen as sinful. Many furries report choosing a fursona based on traits of the animal they identify with or wish to embody. At the same time, these are shorthands - not everyone has the same associations and not everyone is gesturing at the same set of traits. These differences in what a shorthand is taken to communicate can be a point of friction. When someone says they are a dog, that they want to be treated and perceived like one, this is a specific kind of interactional request. And if it feels like someone has misjudged the degree of seriousness of your request, that can feel really disrespectful. Someone treating this identity less seriously than you do can come off as trivializing and dismissive, like they're merely humouring you. For many creatures these identities hold deep importance. Even outside of spiritual beliefs, animal identities can tie into deep feelings of alienation from human society, or serve as metaphors for past experiences of mistreatment. While all identity may be play on some level, it is also often deeply personal and serious, and should be treated as such. At the same time, someone treating this identity more seriously than you can hit its own speed-bumps. Someone emphasizing the degree to which they want to be treated like an animal in all aspects of their life to a partner may be met with disgust at the idea of being involved with an animal sexually. While no-one should be expected to be involved in sex they aren't comfortable with, its important to be clear headed about what is actually being invoked here. Fucking a furry/therian/animal headmate is not the same as sexually abusing a bodily animal - most headmates simply are capable of consent in a way most animals are not. In the situations where a headmate is considered to have equivalent sapience to a literal animal, that's a matter for the system themselves to decide and set boundaries around. But this will always have some degree of metaphor, a gap between the two concepts. One blessing for communicating these kinds of shorthanding accurately is the tool of online communication. For many people using messaging apps regularly, someone's avatar can become closely tied to how they are perceived. Simply setting an avatar to an image that conveys the level of animality intended can often smooth over this process entirely. This is why tools like PluralKit (or more involved forms of digital avatars in games, VR, etc.) can be extremely important for nonhuman and plural communities. Providing both a sense of embodiment/self-recognition, and aiding the recognition of others. These principles, which I first observed in furry communities, are why I choose to use \"furry\" as my core theoretical tool of analysis here - preferring to centre interaction over more metaphysical identity-focused terminology. This is also a basis I carry with me into discussions of identity play and other queer or non-normative identities generally. Having established this groundwork, we can move further into these discussions. Part 2: Fictives Much of the preceding discussion of furry identity also applies to those who identify with/as a fictional character. However fictives are often treated with significantly more suspicion and apprehension than those with non-human identities - often incurring accusations of outright delusional thinking. Part of this is likely due to differences in the public perception of both groups. The default furry in many people's imaginaries lies further on the \"fictional persona for roleplay/cosplay\" end of the spectrum - cultural practices which have experienced some degree of normalisation. Whereas publicly identifying as a fictional character often incurs the assumption you think you are, essentially, an exact copy of the character as though they'd walked directly out of the media and into your brain. While these more intense identifications do exist and should be respected, these assumptions are out of line with most fictive experiences. Any engagement with media is an act of reading, with meaning created between reader and text. Thus no two fictives will have identical understandings of the character they both identify with. Indeed they may not even intend to invoke the entirety of the character to which they refer. Rather than wishing to invite a long discussion of a particular story or the metaphysics of identity, an assertion like \"I'm a Vriska\" might simply be a shorthand intended to gesture at a collection of personality traits and physical features a headmate possesses. The space for these looser associations is often denied to fictives but is critical for respectful interactions with us. How strongly a given fictive relates to their source is something only they can tell you, but over-assuming the strength of these associations can lead to many frustrating and upsetting points of conflict or distress. Being treated like you are the same as or interchangeable with your source can feel extremely objectifying. Similarly, even benign conversations about a fictional character you identify with can become charged when it's unclear how separate from the character someone sees you as. To some degree these conversations will always be sensitive, especially when a particular piece of media was significant enough to affect your identity in this way, but making it clear that your own reading of a text does not negatively impact your perception of others who identify with its characters is an important safeguard. While being treated as distinct from your source is important, fully disassociating yourself from your source can also feel like losing something critical about your identity - explaining yourself to others without a core piece of you. And while the act of reading means not everyone will intuitively understand what parts of a character are or aren't also a part of you, sometimes understandings do just click together naturally in a way they wouldn't without the reference point of the source character. When someone really gets what you saw of yourself in a character and can transfer those understandings to you, when you have the space to build a rapport on top of that while still being treated as distinct, it can be really special. Having spaces where fictives can be open with their identities like this, without the fear of objectification or othering, is really important. Distancing yourself from your source by changing what name or visuals you use online is a thing many fictives do as they develop a more independent sense of self. But far too often these same actions are taken defensively - if you cannot be recognised as a fictive you cannot be challenged or interrogated on that identity. When we can create spaces in which these experiences are treated as normal and mundane, we ease that pressure to mask these parts of plural (or indeed singlet) identities. And these kinds of identity are in fact normal. On smaller scales people appropriate pieces of identity from media all the time. Buying the cool jacket you saw someone wear in a movie, naming yourself after a character you liked, dyeing your hair, getting tattoos or piercings to look more like a girl you thought was cute, emulating or avoiding the decisions of a character in a story - all of these behaviours are essentially mundane. We live in a cultural milieu of both media and other people from which to form our identities, where subcultural styles like \"goth\" or \"punk\" can coalesce around particular media and a collection of aesthetic signifiers. As such, it is hardly a shade stranger to watch the development of a \"furry\" aesthetic, or to see a confluence of girls all identifying as \"twilight sparkle\". Part 2.5: Factives The apprehension felt around fictive identities is only magnified for headmates identifying with real (living or dead) people - often referred to as \"factives\" or \"introjects\". While our prior discussion of fictives still largely applies here, and any identification will naturally be an act of reading based on ones own perceptions, this can actually create greater hostility. To claim to in some sense \"be\" another person, who you only know through a limited view into their life, is often treated like a highly disrespectful kind of \"playing pretend\". But our identities are formed through interactions with others. Personally, our system has been repeatedly shaped by interactions with close friends; picking up forms, aesthetics, interests, and incorporating them into our own identity. You might not know you want a particular kind of expression until you see it elsewhere, or you might have a vague \"I wish I could be some kind of cool cyborg\"-type desire that only gets fleshed out by talking through the idea with others with similar identities. Sometimes these influences are subtle, sometimes you find a critical mass of identity that can only look like a copy of someone else. Experiencing this with public figures you have a one-sided relationship is no different - sometimes the thing that resonates in media is a fictional character, sometimes its a real person (filtered, as they are, through the same media processes). There are some reasonable concerns when it comes to navigating factive identity. If we introjected a friend from another system, it would be worth making some effort to distinguish their online personas - having identical names, avatars, etc. may cause confusion, and some visual depictions may feel highly personal to the person who originated them. Being conscious of the distinction between a person and the version of that person in your own system, is again an important principle here. But, at the same time, being forced to deny these kinds of connections can really suck. Carefully obfuscating a headmate's source or influences so as to avoid judgemental comments on their existence is common practice - and shouldn't have to be. Knowing you affected someone else in this way can stir up a lot of complicated feelings, but having an influence on other people's identity formations is a really special thing. Avoid getting an ego about it (\"I made you this way\" tends to suck no matter the realisation you helped with), but understand it as a natural part of living as a social animal, and the sharing of such information as an act of deep trust. Part 3: Age Regressors There are a myriad of reasons one might identify with an age different to the age of their body, but what this identification is taken to mean varies a lot, especially across different communities. In a lot of plural spaces, system littles/middles, who consistently identify with an age under the age of majority, are presumed to be essentially equivalent to a child that same age, needing to always be treated as such. This lies in contrast to a lot of singlet age regression spaces, where it is generally understood that having a headspace in which you feel and act like a kid is nonsexual for some and sexual for others (the lines between \"age regression\" and \"ageplay\" as a kink often blur here). To treat plural systems with two identity states (\u201cme as an adult\u201d and \u201cme as a child\u201d) as fundamentally different from a singlet-identified experience of those same two states is definitionally a double standard. Even drawing a clear distinction between one headmate experiencing age regression and the system having a separate little headmate can be near impossible for some. It seems almost inevitable that some systems will have \"littles\" with sexualities, who want to engage with that in a variety of ways. However suggesting that some system littles may deserve more autonomy, or may be able to consent, often causes some very understandable concerns. The key here once again is shorthanding. When a bodily/chronological/legal adult states \u201cim 12\u201d this is understood to not be one-to-one literal. The question is which elements of that concept are and aren\u2019t being carried across. For many systems they do use this language to indicate a difference in maturity, capacity for consent, etc. and it is important to respect this and treat those headmates appropriately. For others though, the association can be more abstract, indicating a difference in interests, vibes or aesthetics, but retaining the knowledge or competency of an adult. Being conscious of the different usages at play and sensitive to the needs and comforts of others is highly important here. For littles who need to avoid mature topics and environments it is important this is recognised and respected. Similarly for spaces that cannot accommodate children, it may be important for a system to keep these kinds of littles out of those spaces, or to try avoid dropping unexpected childcare responsibilities in someone\u2019s lap. At the same time, for some other littles, respecting their autonomy to make adult decisions and live their life despite the younger aspects of their self can be equally important. If the only headmate who can front for an extended period is a mature but childlike little, should they be expected to simply disappear from all social spaces with adults, at the risk of making someone uncomfortable with their age regressor swag? I would hope not. Indeed headmate ages may be uncertain, or something a system does not wish to disclose at all for safety reasons. Median systems may never be able to guarantee your interactions effect or include none of their younger parts. There is a fundamental trust that has to be extended to systems to know what is best and safest for them and their headmates. If you are asked to treat given headmates as though they are vulnerable children this is an expression of great trust, yet so is expressing to you that I want to be treated like a cute kid but with the freedoms and autonomy of an adult. Anxieties around these discussions are understandable, especially when it is unclear how much they are acting as proxies for discussions of the treatment of bodily children more broadly. Even speaking in the other direction, gesturing at headmates being \"older than the body\" can raise hackles about what that might imply of someone's beliefs around ages of consent. What's important in these discussions is to take care and be clear about what we are and aren't saying. Child abuse happens as a result of the legal and social disempowerment of children, and the power differentials created by vast gaps in experience or understanding that can make such abuse seem acceptable or normal. When interacting with system littles/middles, many or even all of these factors may be absent. Fundamentally the choice of how to treat a system's experience of differing age feelings is their own to make. But with any discussion of the complex intersections of sexuality and this felt age, its important to avoid kneejerk disgust and be clearheaded about what does and does not constitute material harm. Part 4: Family The use of familial terms to describe headmate relationships holds much in common with the preceding discussion of age. Describing headmates as having sibling or parent-child relationships can convey a number of important facets of a relationship. Maybe you feel like you grew up together with a specific headmate and want to call them your sister. Maybe you provide care and support to a little in your system and they feel like your child because of it. The shorthanding or metaphorical element here is clear \u2013 biological relations, legal rights, and many of the power dynamics of The Family do not exist within a system. Instead this has more in common with other queer re-appropriations of familial terms - the feelings of closeness or solidarity that might make a trans girl call another trans girl her sister, or the nurturing mentoring relationships that might lead to calling another trans girl her mom. At the same time it's hard to ignore the elephant in the room here - kink. The same closeness that can create familial feelings between headmates often also leads to sexual relationships, and where these intersect it can often be in the form of incest roleplay. Even if the familial terms are never involved in sex for a pair of headmates, mentioning both aspects of a relationship may invoke the association in others. This can lead to situations where systems feel like they can only disclose either the sexual/romantic parts of their relationship or the familial, rather than risk disclosing both and making someone uncomfortable with information they can't take back. Both these aspects of headmate relationships can have deep importance, and omitting parts of them from explanations of your system may feel like giving someone an incomplete picture. Yet discomforts with the blurring of the two are also understandable. This dilemma is not unique to plurality however - many singlets have important kink relationships in their lives and similarly have to tiptoe around describing them. While the malleability of identity in kink roleplay can facilitate self exploration, the relationships formed this way often permeate beyond the scene itself ( Hale 1997 ). While a role like \"daddy\" or \"pet\" might have a sexual context within a scene, aspects of such a role might continue entirely non-sexually outside of such (similar to calling one\u2019s partner \u201cbaby\u201d). These relationships can become extremely significant and important in someone's life, as with similar relationships within systems. We should accept that it may be important to recognise a 24/7 relationship with a day collar in the same way we do a marriage with a wedding ring, and not stigmatise such practices. A similar degree of understanding must also be given to pets and their owners, mommies/daddies and their littles, and so on. The relationship need not be 24/7, allowing for fluid identification as needed (often who needs to be the kid getting cared for flips back and forth in my relationships and system). And while there may be discomfort or triggers associated for some, accommodating this can happen on a case by case basis, avoiding foregrounding or referring to these relationships where necessary, or adjusting what language is used depending on the rules or needs of a space. What is crucial is making sure there are spaces where these relationships can be talked about openly, normalising their existence rather than banishing them to a realm of unspeakable stigma. Part 5: Gender Philosophy 5.1 - The Material When reasoning about trans identity and gendered oppression, from a specifically transfeminist lens, words can hold quite specific theoretical meanings (as with most academic fields). In these contexts we may use \"transfem\" and \"transmasc\" to refer to specific relationships to gender assignment and the directions these assignments are transgressed. The same procedure may be denied to a trans youth but pressured onto an intersex youth, based on which genders the medical, legal and social systems around them have decided they each should be. This is the process of gender assignment. At the same time, how someone transgresses the gendered order is perceived differently based on the nature of the transgression. Feminine gender expressions are devalued, associated with artificiality, and thus transfeminine gender expressions are most strongly marginalised within society. This is the phenomena of transmisogyny ( Serano 2007 ). On a personal and a practical level, as a transfem system, while some of our headmates identify as boys and have corresponding self images, our body being transfeminized makes all of us subject to institutional transmisogyny. We know the history of how bodies like ours have been simultaneously fetishized and reviled, and that people like us are more often than not the primary target of trans panics. Plurality can also create a number of strange intersections with the forces of transphobia and misogyny. We notice the ways a boy fronting and performing a more masculine gender will often be taken more seriously. Even when presenting as a feminine boy in a transfem system, there can be more insulation from having your gender undercut by misgendering, and this often makes it easier for some headmates to front than others. The repeated subtle cissexism of being treated better when you present like your assigned gender (or the sexism of being treated better for presenting as a guy) and have the corresponding headmates in front, can be a really pernicious force on a system. 5.2 - The Metaphorical To position a boy in a transfem system as \"cis\" however, can feel reductive. Such headmates may have been active participants in decisions to feminise a body (and may reasonably consider themselves also transfeminine as a result), but they may also have had to actively work to make that same body also accommodate them. And for many transgender systems, headmates whose genders align with their assigned gender can be put in strange positions, sharing a number of experiences with those transitioning in the opposite direction. A boy in a transfem system that has medically transitioned may find they need to bind in order to front comfortably, or use a packer post bottom surgery. A girl in a transmasc system may similarly find herself needing to shave facial hair, or use breast-forms after top surgery. What gender technologies a given headmate uses to help present in a way that works for them, given the bodily compromises the system has had to make, can leave a headmate with contradictory experiences. Often this leads to using convenient shorthands along the lines of \"Our system is transfem, but I'm transmasc\" or vice versa. (Fictive identities and internal self perceptions may also bring one to this kind of metaphor, albeit for slightly different reasons.) While this may seem to conflict with the earlier definition of these terms, understanding this as a shorthand can provide clarity here. While it would be obviously inappropriate for a boy in a transfem system to insert themself into a discussion of transmasculine experiences and speak as an authority on the topic, or for a transmasculine system to use \"well some of my headmates are transfem\" to claim they cannot benefit from structural transmisogyny, these shorthands are, in my experience, generally not being used in such a way. Rather, like any seemingly contradictory use of labels, these identifications are usually meant to draw out the tensions between the two terms and gesture at a range of shared or difficult to articulate experiences. Use of such shorthands still requires care, and there's a number of less obvious pitfalls to be aware of. Implications of a headmate as \"transfem because they're a girl with a dick\" or \"transmasc because they're a boy with tits/a pussy\" are going to read as transphobic, even if that\u2019s the professed identity and self concept of a given headmate. Simply put, those traits are not what makes someone trans, and are not universal traits among those trans populations. Similarly, a headmate wanting or having a set of sex/gender characteristics outside the binary would not make them intersex (unless the system already was), because that term refers to a specific relationship to gender assignment. We are in the messy deep end of shorthanding now, and it pays to talk to the people around you about your language use and make sure they're comfortable how you use these shorthands. But language can serve different purposes in different contexts, and what matters here is being aware of what context you're in and what language is appropriate for that context. 5.3 - Synthesis More metaphorical identity language can help articulate nuances of experience. \"In many ways it feels like our transition was not Male to Female, but a transition to Plural. To being able to be understood as multiple, and as disparate genders within specific social spaces\" But there is also a place for the specific and the technical, especially when reasoning about systems of oppression. \"No matter how I choose to identify, the choices I have made about my body position me as transfeminized and I interface with systems of power and oppression on that basis\u201d Part 6: Race Before we continue, I'd like to put my cards on the table here. I'm a white girl. For every previous section where I have been writing out of personal experience, I have had a claim to epistemic authority by nature of my identity. But for this section I lack the firsthand experience of racialization. While it would be easier to say I simply shouldn't touch this topic, and leave this work to a system of color, I think that would be doing a disservice. Racial allyship requires listening - true, but it also requires meaningfully engaging with the experience and theories of the racially marginalised, critically engaging with that work, and being willing to speak to it yourself. To simply defer to the opinion of any system of color in earshot on these topics, absolving myself of any duty to engage with them critically, would be an act of intellectual cowardice. I think it has done our fledgling plural communities a disservice to only refer to these topics in hushed tones, and so I offer you my best effort at openly reasoning with them below. 6.1 - A Preamble on the Pragmatics of Talking Race Many online discussions of cultural appropriation get bogged down in questions of terminology; is something really appropriation, is appropriation always wrong, etc. Discourse flattens entirely justified critiques into a simple taboo. \"That's AAVE you shouldn't use it\" gets responded to with \"isn't it kinda racist to say i shouldn't use words invented by black people\" and we have thus entirely left the vicinity of the original point. While it's possible to respond productively on these terms (articulating, say, the differences between natural linguistic contact and linguistic appropriation), I think it's often much easier to avoid the moral argument, and take a more pragmatic tack on these discourses. Put simply, if you carelessly pick up a bunch of words and cultural signifiers without regard for their original meanings, it's gonna look embarrassing . Putting on a bad blaccent will get you side-eyed from people who understand the dialects you're crudely imitating, and can tell it isn't natural for you. I'm no fan of employing social stigma to shape behaviour, but I think \"its a bad look\" is often a much more straightforward argument to make, and often cuts closer to the core of the issue. It's not a moral issue for a kid to want to regurgitate a bunch of funny memes they saw online, but when their idea of \"gen z slang\" includes AAVE they seem to think is funny in and of itself, that sure ends up looking racist. You avoid this by educating yourself and making conscious decisions about the language you're using and why, and cultural signifiers are no different. 6.2 - Actually Talking Headmates and Race The principle that headmates do not always look like the body has an often uncomfortable implication that we do have to address before we can finish here - sometimes people's headmates look like a different race to their body. While there are nuances to self perception, and many systems have some degree of choice on how they conceptualise themselves (a fictive might choose to distance themself from elements of their depiction deemed racist, for example), that kind of control does not appear to be absolute. Bottom line, these identifications do and will exist, whether we like it or not. It's important here, to make sure we have some distinctions clear; Physical features/Appearance: how someone looks. Race: the social construct. Created by processes of racialization and oppression. Historically contingent and separate from the racialized features it is mapped onto. Culture: the collections of beliefs, language and practices shared by a particular social or ethnic group. Take the case of a white US-American system with a \"black\" headmate. While their headmate may share a number of perceived features with black Americans, they will not have the same experiences of racialization, and will likely have some distance from black culture. The same way a black American therian won't lose their experiences of racialization and culture even if they'd prefer to be perceived as a wolf. Simply put, experiences of racialization and culture exist irrespective of internal appearance and identity. \"Is my furry headmate white? I mean they're not even human\" is a confusion solved by simply separating your concept of \"race\" from how someone looks. Keeping a clear head about these distinctions when discussing these topics is essential. If we know which things we're referring to and everyone involved is on the same page, shorthanding around racialized features may be possible, similar to how we conceptualised gender. But it's again important to be conscious of how and where you invoke these shorthands, and I'd advise greater caution here. It would be obviously inappropriate to use a headmate's appearance as an argument for your epistemic authority in discussions of race, but its also important to avoid seeming to trivialise these matters more generally. This is also where the prior discussion of optics and \"bad looks\" becomes important. The question of, say, how a fictive of a character from another culture should present, is mostly one of pragmatics. Using a name from a culture that is not your own, artistic depictions of yourself as a race other than your body - these may all be possible in contexts with close friends who are on the same page as you with regards to these issues. But in broader public spaces its often going to be necessary to adjust your behaviour, to avoid seeming to present yourself as a race/ethnicity you are not. It can suck as a fictive, identifying strongly with your canon depiction, but needing to choose e.g. alternate names to use in more public spaces, so as not to unintentionally deceive acquaintances and come off like a white girl race-faking online, but this is inevitably worth doing. It's not a bad thing to identify with works from, or aspects of, another culture. And I don't believe plural systems, fictives, or factives, are any more prone to being disrespectful than singlets are. For any system playing too fast and loose with names they liked from an anime, or cultural practices they lack a claim to, there's a singlet who's also become obsessed with that culture and engages with it in similarly inappropriate ways. The only difference is the plural system has specific headmates to pin these behaviours on. There's certainly plenty of white rap fans singing along with the n-word, wearing dreadlocks or cornrows, or picking up aspects of hip-hop style without needing to claim they have a black headmate - some of these are obviously inappropriate behaviours, some require a level of discernment about an individuals distance from, or engagement with, the culture who's styles they are emulating. There are nuances to these matters too. Racialized systems may have more leeway when identifying with the dominant culture (a \"white girl headmate\" is more clearly a claim to identification with dominant cultural tropes than to a lack of racialization), but should still be cautious around identifications with differently racialized groups. For mixed race systems, or those who've been raised cross-culturally, there may be genuine cultural connections to multiple different groups, which may express themselves across different headmates (e.g. some headmates speaking a mother tongue better than others). What matters is having sensitivity to the cultures you're engaging with, and being authentic and open about your own experiences. Negotiating these dynamics is inevitably hard, and each system will have to find their own balance. It's important to understand the material consequences of racism, and defer to the comforts of racialized people in your life as to what kinds of shorthands they're comfortable with you using around them. But avoiding these topics entirely, for fear of getting it wrong, only prevents us from having those conversations in the first place. Part 7: Disability Differences between headmate self-conceptions and a system's body also come into play for discussions of disability. It's not uncommon for headmates to have differences in height, limbs, or sense organs, and while this is largely unproblematic for the 40ft tall eight-eyed dogtaur, it can become a point of discomfort where it aligns with real world disabilities. Mismatches between body and sense of self can be really painful. Dysphoria about height. Desires non-human features like a tail or claws. Outright alienation from a \"human\" body. Any feeling of wrongness like this is deeply personal and sensitive. But, while the 10cm tall faerie can use this language to describe her idealised form with ease, a headmate closer to 4ft, who's body is taller than this, will have to contend with the fact there are many people that height, some of whom are adults who've faced significant discrimination due to their stature. Phantom limbs can hurt, and many systems' headmates limbs differ from their bodies'. The werewolf headmate can wear a tail to substitute for missing sensations. The headmate who's form lacks legs, in an able-bodied system, has to be sensitive to the experiences of those with disabling limb differences. A headmate who's self conception lacks vision may find their body's sight actively painful, but significant vision impairments are still disabling within society, and its important to remain sensitive to this fact. Similarly, a \"deaf headmate\" in a hearing system still will need to be respectful in their interactions with Deaf culture and when learning sign languages, as any hearing person would. The question of how to square these realities is simply another variation on our prior discussions of shorthanding. Distinguish between internal perceptions and physical impairments. Be more careful where your language could be ambiguous as to which it refers. And talk to those in your life affected by the discrimination at hand. Part 8: Fatness 8.1 - In Society When we talk about differences between headmates internally felt appearances and their systems' bodies, these matters exist on a spectrum. Race is a matter of lived experience that may shift contextually as someone moves through different cultural contexts, but is relatively static. Disability is a category many people enter at different points in their lives, but can also be lifelong. Species is essentially fixed, but good allegories and communication can shift perceptions. Gendering is deeply malleable, and often the way someone is gendered is simply down to a handful of cues the people around them have learned to make predictions from. So where in this should we place the category of \"fat\"? People who's bodies are deemed unacceptably \"fat\" are discriminated against in all layers of society. From large scale issues of medical neglect, clothing and the built environment rarely considering the needs of fat bodies, to bullying, harassment and abuse in interpersonal contexts. Many people are fat their whole lives, and most attempts to change this are actively harmful. Yet this category is malleable. Definitions of \"fat\" are not fixed, with many people leaving the category and many more entering it at any given time. It is also, straightforwardly, not wrong to want to become fatter. Intentional weight gain, be it for eating disorder recovery, weight gain kink, or any other reason, is just as beautiful an act of bodily autonomy and self-creation as gender transition or body modification (including for species affirmation). 8.2 - In Kink With kink based weight gain, there's a line to be walked between these tensions. Lots of fat fetish art deliberately plays with negative tropes associated with fatness, depicting it as gross, unhealthy, or a result of poor diet and lack of exercise. Bringing these tropes around your fat friends, who have likely experienced discrimination over their weight, or at least lived in the cultural milieu in which fat people are the butt of the joke across most popular media, can easily be rude or outright triggering. But not all weight related kink art is this way. I would personally credit a lot of fetish art directly with improving our own body image. Fatfur and fat fetish art that expanded our conceptions of bodies that could be desirable to be or be with (often the distinction making art \"fat fetish\" content is simply that someone is depicted as fat and desirable). Weight gain art that depicted eating and gaining weight as joyous and healing. Putting on more body fat directly helped our dysphoria, due to shifts across all of our body - not just those parts deemed socially acceptable to be larger. It is reasonable, as a fat person, to want to be kept away from the more negative tropes around weight gain kink, feedism and fat fetish art. The same way a trans woman might want to avoid forcefem and sissification kinks for the way they often treat becoming a woman as a humiliating and shameful thing. Yet in both cases we must understand these categories to not be fully separate. Many trans women come to their identities through feminisation kink spaces, and many weight gain kinksters are fat, or are becoming so (it's kind of the whole point). Barring those with unpalatable kinds of body desires from our communities only hurts our most vulnerable, though careless evocation of tropes and stereotypes can too. So we must again balance the comforts of the marginalised in our communities, with that which we find expressive or affirming. 8.3 - In Plural Systems When this comes down to the matter of headmate depictions, there are a few concerns at play. For some, gesturing at the concept of \"fat headmates\" and \"skinny headmates\" can seem trivializing in ways that bristle against personal histories of oppression. Yet understanding members of our system's ideal forms as fatter allowed us to intentionally work towards that as a goal for our body. At this point the \"skinny headmates\" are those who have not kept up, associating themselves with past forms of our body, or struggling to conceptualize their aesthetics as something available to larger bodies. It's always worth taking care in the comforts of those around you, but understand people's body images as deeply personal too, and be careful when approaching any seeming mismatches in descriptions of weight. That \"fat headmate\" might also have a fat body, or a complicated and sensitive history with their body's weight too. Conclusion We have avoided, for most of this essay, moralizing the shapes anyone's headmates take. But I do think it is productive, as a system, to think about your headmates' representations and what they reflect. Fictives often have to reject parts of their sources that they disagree with or find objectionable, and thinking about what tropes and biases may be reflected by the shape of your system is important. But it's also easy to trap yourself in a specific realm of expression based on what seems available to you: deciding you can't have a \"sexual alter\" and be forward or provocative or even hot due to self esteem issues or fears of how those behaviours would be construed, deciding to sideline the \"straight boy\" parts of your identity or sexuality in favour of those that seem more politically liberated, defaulting to seeing your headmates as skinny because being fat while being hot or having a cool aesthetic is almost never depicted in media you see. These perceptions can change, and open up new possibilities for personal expression. Maybe your body doesn't always need to change to meet your internal self, instead letting these perceptions exist in dialogue with one another: The hormones that change your body, the allegories and signifiers you adorn yourself with - horn headbands and collars, and the allowance for images of yourself to get fatter, include mobility aids, or any other part of yourself deemed less palatable by society. Accepting this dialogue between the idealised, allegorical, and physical selves opens up space to embody parts of yourself that cannot physically manifest: the space to unmask and be more of an animal, the space to age regress and connect with different parts of yourself or your history, the space to be plural itself. We have not aimed to give conclusive answers here. Language is inexact and inevitably sensitive to each persons own context. Declaring a given identity claim (or discomfort with that claim) an inherent problem would indicate a certainty I don't claim to have. What I do know, is for each of these topics, in public or private, we've watched an argument spark up that could have started on better terms. These topics are sensitive, and plural identity is often reduced to very absolute and essentialized terms. What I hope I've offered is a better starting point for talking about these issues; that you can productively engage with these perspectives and experiences, integrate them with your own, find the points where you disagree or your context is different, and take that into the world to actually have these conversations, and have them better than you would have otherwise. -mk References Hale, C.

Gender, sexuality, fashion and subcultural styles all gain meaning through interaction with others and are constrained by social forces. Seeing something you want in another person, some aspect of their presentation or behaviour, and adopting that for yourself is a normal part of identity formation. Seeing and meeting girls that I wanted to be like, or that I saw parts of myself in, helped me become a girl. As also happened for me with many other identity realisations. Yet language is inexact and polysemous. To say that I have a particular identity, be it \"trans\", \"plural\", \"autistic\" or \"woman\" does not guarantee the same experience as anyone sharing those labels, although shared definitions may help ensure some overlap. For some identity descriptors however, the inexactness is the point, attempting to gesture at something ineffable through metaphorical extensions of language. Metaphorical uses of language, and the shorthands they create, are central to a number of contentious questions of identity within plural and nonhuman spaces. It is my hope that by outlining these subjects and our approaches to them, we can help other systems avoid a number of painful arguments and misunderstandings we have either borne witness to or experienced first hand.","title":"Intro: Language, Metaphor and Identity"},{"location":"shorthanding/#part-1-furries","text":"\"A girl says her boyfriend is \"a golden retriever\". Is she simply gesturing at a particular set of affable personality traits? Or is he a furry, who presents online with an anthropomorphic depiction of the animal? Does he adopt more behavioural traits, ask for pets, wear a collar, eat from a bowl? Is he a therian and holds some spiritual or metaphysical belief in his golden retriever-ness?\" Whatever the answer here, there remains some gap between the literal biological canine and the one identifying with it. But this metaphorical identification exists to gesture at a whole range of traits that might be carried across to the person in question to varying degrees. Cultural shorthands like this can be extremely effective. Presenting as a demon online may easily convey some rejection of Christian morality - embracing behaviours or traits seen as sinful. Many furries report choosing a fursona based on traits of the animal they identify with or wish to embody. At the same time, these are shorthands - not everyone has the same associations and not everyone is gesturing at the same set of traits. These differences in what a shorthand is taken to communicate can be a point of friction. When someone says they are a dog, that they want to be treated and perceived like one, this is a specific kind of interactional request. And if it feels like someone has misjudged the degree of seriousness of your request, that can feel really disrespectful. Someone treating this identity less seriously than you do can come off as trivializing and dismissive, like they're merely humouring you. For many creatures these identities hold deep importance. Even outside of spiritual beliefs, animal identities can tie into deep feelings of alienation from human society, or serve as metaphors for past experiences of mistreatment. While all identity may be play on some level, it is also often deeply personal and serious, and should be treated as such. At the same time, someone treating this identity more seriously than you can hit its own speed-bumps. Someone emphasizing the degree to which they want to be treated like an animal in all aspects of their life to a partner may be met with disgust at the idea of being involved with an animal sexually. While no-one should be expected to be involved in sex they aren't comfortable with, its important to be clear headed about what is actually being invoked here. Fucking a furry/therian/animal headmate is not the same as sexually abusing a bodily animal - most headmates simply are capable of consent in a way most animals are not. In the situations where a headmate is considered to have equivalent sapience to a literal animal, that's a matter for the system themselves to decide and set boundaries around. But this will always have some degree of metaphor, a gap between the two concepts. One blessing for communicating these kinds of shorthanding accurately is the tool of online communication. For many people using messaging apps regularly, someone's avatar can become closely tied to how they are perceived. Simply setting an avatar to an image that conveys the level of animality intended can often smooth over this process entirely. This is why tools like PluralKit (or more involved forms of digital avatars in games, VR, etc.) can be extremely important for nonhuman and plural communities. Providing both a sense of embodiment/self-recognition, and aiding the recognition of others. These principles, which I first observed in furry communities, are why I choose to use \"furry\" as my core theoretical tool of analysis here - preferring to centre interaction over more metaphysical identity-focused terminology. This is also a basis I carry with me into discussions of identity play and other queer or non-normative identities generally. Having established this groundwork, we can move further into these discussions.","title":"Part 1: Furries"},{"location":"shorthanding/#part-2-fictives","text":"Much of the preceding discussion of furry identity also applies to those who identify with/as a fictional character. However fictives are often treated with significantly more suspicion and apprehension than those with non-human identities - often incurring accusations of outright delusional thinking. Part of this is likely due to differences in the public perception of both groups. The default furry in many people's imaginaries lies further on the \"fictional persona for roleplay/cosplay\" end of the spectrum - cultural practices which have experienced some degree of normalisation. Whereas publicly identifying as a fictional character often incurs the assumption you think you are, essentially, an exact copy of the character as though they'd walked directly out of the media and into your brain. While these more intense identifications do exist and should be respected, these assumptions are out of line with most fictive experiences. Any engagement with media is an act of reading, with meaning created between reader and text. Thus no two fictives will have identical understandings of the character they both identify with. Indeed they may not even intend to invoke the entirety of the character to which they refer. Rather than wishing to invite a long discussion of a particular story or the metaphysics of identity, an assertion like \"I'm a Vriska\" might simply be a shorthand intended to gesture at a collection of personality traits and physical features a headmate possesses. The space for these looser associations is often denied to fictives but is critical for respectful interactions with us. How strongly a given fictive relates to their source is something only they can tell you, but over-assuming the strength of these associations can lead to many frustrating and upsetting points of conflict or distress. Being treated like you are the same as or interchangeable with your source can feel extremely objectifying. Similarly, even benign conversations about a fictional character you identify with can become charged when it's unclear how separate from the character someone sees you as. To some degree these conversations will always be sensitive, especially when a particular piece of media was significant enough to affect your identity in this way, but making it clear that your own reading of a text does not negatively impact your perception of others who identify with its characters is an important safeguard. While being treated as distinct from your source is important, fully disassociating yourself from your source can also feel like losing something critical about your identity - explaining yourself to others without a core piece of you. And while the act of reading means not everyone will intuitively understand what parts of a character are or aren't also a part of you, sometimes understandings do just click together naturally in a way they wouldn't without the reference point of the source character. When someone really gets what you saw of yourself in a character and can transfer those understandings to you, when you have the space to build a rapport on top of that while still being treated as distinct, it can be really special. Having spaces where fictives can be open with their identities like this, without the fear of objectification or othering, is really important. Distancing yourself from your source by changing what name or visuals you use online is a thing many fictives do as they develop a more independent sense of self. But far too often these same actions are taken defensively - if you cannot be recognised as a fictive you cannot be challenged or interrogated on that identity. When we can create spaces in which these experiences are treated as normal and mundane, we ease that pressure to mask these parts of plural (or indeed singlet) identities. And these kinds of identity are in fact normal. On smaller scales people appropriate pieces of identity from media all the time. Buying the cool jacket you saw someone wear in a movie, naming yourself after a character you liked, dyeing your hair, getting tattoos or piercings to look more like a girl you thought was cute, emulating or avoiding the decisions of a character in a story - all of these behaviours are essentially mundane. We live in a cultural milieu of both media and other people from which to form our identities, where subcultural styles like \"goth\" or \"punk\" can coalesce around particular media and a collection of aesthetic signifiers. As such, it is hardly a shade stranger to watch the development of a \"furry\" aesthetic, or to see a confluence of girls all identifying as \"twilight sparkle\".","title":"Part 2: Fictives"},{"location":"shorthanding/#part-25-factives","text":"The apprehension felt around fictive identities is only magnified for headmates identifying with real (living or dead) people - often referred to as \"factives\" or \"introjects\". While our prior discussion of fictives still largely applies here, and any identification will naturally be an act of reading based on ones own perceptions, this can actually create greater hostility. To claim to in some sense \"be\" another person, who you only know through a limited view into their life, is often treated like a highly disrespectful kind of \"playing pretend\". But our identities are formed through interactions with others. Personally, our system has been repeatedly shaped by interactions with close friends; picking up forms, aesthetics, interests, and incorporating them into our own identity. You might not know you want a particular kind of expression until you see it elsewhere, or you might have a vague \"I wish I could be some kind of cool cyborg\"-type desire that only gets fleshed out by talking through the idea with others with similar identities. Sometimes these influences are subtle, sometimes you find a critical mass of identity that can only look like a copy of someone else. Experiencing this with public figures you have a one-sided relationship is no different - sometimes the thing that resonates in media is a fictional character, sometimes its a real person (filtered, as they are, through the same media processes). There are some reasonable concerns when it comes to navigating factive identity. If we introjected a friend from another system, it would be worth making some effort to distinguish their online personas - having identical names, avatars, etc. may cause confusion, and some visual depictions may feel highly personal to the person who originated them. Being conscious of the distinction between a person and the version of that person in your own system, is again an important principle here. But, at the same time, being forced to deny these kinds of connections can really suck. Carefully obfuscating a headmate's source or influences so as to avoid judgemental comments on their existence is common practice - and shouldn't have to be. Knowing you affected someone else in this way can stir up a lot of complicated feelings, but having an influence on other people's identity formations is a really special thing. Avoid getting an ego about it (\"I made you this way\" tends to suck no matter the realisation you helped with), but understand it as a natural part of living as a social animal, and the sharing of such information as an act of deep trust.","title":"Part 2.5: Factives"},{"location":"shorthanding/#part-3-age-regressors","text":"There are a myriad of reasons one might identify with an age different to the age of their body, but what this identification is taken to mean varies a lot, especially across different communities. In a lot of plural spaces, system littles/middles, who consistently identify with an age under the age of majority, are presumed to be essentially equivalent to a child that same age, needing to always be treated as such. This lies in contrast to a lot of singlet age regression spaces, where it is generally understood that having a headspace in which you feel and act like a kid is nonsexual for some and sexual for others (the lines between \"age regression\" and \"ageplay\" as a kink often blur here). To treat plural systems with two identity states (\u201cme as an adult\u201d and \u201cme as a child\u201d) as fundamentally different from a singlet-identified experience of those same two states is definitionally a double standard. Even drawing a clear distinction between one headmate experiencing age regression and the system having a separate little headmate can be near impossible for some. It seems almost inevitable that some systems will have \"littles\" with sexualities, who want to engage with that in a variety of ways. However suggesting that some system littles may deserve more autonomy, or may be able to consent, often causes some very understandable concerns. The key here once again is shorthanding. When a bodily/chronological/legal adult states \u201cim 12\u201d this is understood to not be one-to-one literal. The question is which elements of that concept are and aren\u2019t being carried across. For many systems they do use this language to indicate a difference in maturity, capacity for consent, etc. and it is important to respect this and treat those headmates appropriately. For others though, the association can be more abstract, indicating a difference in interests, vibes or aesthetics, but retaining the knowledge or competency of an adult. Being conscious of the different usages at play and sensitive to the needs and comforts of others is highly important here. For littles who need to avoid mature topics and environments it is important this is recognised and respected. Similarly for spaces that cannot accommodate children, it may be important for a system to keep these kinds of littles out of those spaces, or to try avoid dropping unexpected childcare responsibilities in someone\u2019s lap. At the same time, for some other littles, respecting their autonomy to make adult decisions and live their life despite the younger aspects of their self can be equally important. If the only headmate who can front for an extended period is a mature but childlike little, should they be expected to simply disappear from all social spaces with adults, at the risk of making someone uncomfortable with their age regressor swag? I would hope not. Indeed headmate ages may be uncertain, or something a system does not wish to disclose at all for safety reasons. Median systems may never be able to guarantee your interactions effect or include none of their younger parts. There is a fundamental trust that has to be extended to systems to know what is best and safest for them and their headmates. If you are asked to treat given headmates as though they are vulnerable children this is an expression of great trust, yet so is expressing to you that I want to be treated like a cute kid but with the freedoms and autonomy of an adult. Anxieties around these discussions are understandable, especially when it is unclear how much they are acting as proxies for discussions of the treatment of bodily children more broadly. Even speaking in the other direction, gesturing at headmates being \"older than the body\" can raise hackles about what that might imply of someone's beliefs around ages of consent. What's important in these discussions is to take care and be clear about what we are and aren't saying. Child abuse happens as a result of the legal and social disempowerment of children, and the power differentials created by vast gaps in experience or understanding that can make such abuse seem acceptable or normal. When interacting with system littles/middles, many or even all of these factors may be absent. Fundamentally the choice of how to treat a system's experience of differing age feelings is their own to make. But with any discussion of the complex intersections of sexuality and this felt age, its important to avoid kneejerk disgust and be clearheaded about what does and does not constitute material harm.","title":"Part 3: Age Regressors"},{"location":"shorthanding/#part-4-family","text":"The use of familial terms to describe headmate relationships holds much in common with the preceding discussion of age. Describing headmates as having sibling or parent-child relationships can convey a number of important facets of a relationship. Maybe you feel like you grew up together with a specific headmate and want to call them your sister. Maybe you provide care and support to a little in your system and they feel like your child because of it. The shorthanding or metaphorical element here is clear \u2013 biological relations, legal rights, and many of the power dynamics of The Family do not exist within a system. Instead this has more in common with other queer re-appropriations of familial terms - the feelings of closeness or solidarity that might make a trans girl call another trans girl her sister, or the nurturing mentoring relationships that might lead to calling another trans girl her mom. At the same time it's hard to ignore the elephant in the room here - kink. The same closeness that can create familial feelings between headmates often also leads to sexual relationships, and where these intersect it can often be in the form of incest roleplay. Even if the familial terms are never involved in sex for a pair of headmates, mentioning both aspects of a relationship may invoke the association in others. This can lead to situations where systems feel like they can only disclose either the sexual/romantic parts of their relationship or the familial, rather than risk disclosing both and making someone uncomfortable with information they can't take back. Both these aspects of headmate relationships can have deep importance, and omitting parts of them from explanations of your system may feel like giving someone an incomplete picture. Yet discomforts with the blurring of the two are also understandable. This dilemma is not unique to plurality however - many singlets have important kink relationships in their lives and similarly have to tiptoe around describing them. While the malleability of identity in kink roleplay can facilitate self exploration, the relationships formed this way often permeate beyond the scene itself ( Hale 1997 ). While a role like \"daddy\" or \"pet\" might have a sexual context within a scene, aspects of such a role might continue entirely non-sexually outside of such (similar to calling one\u2019s partner \u201cbaby\u201d). These relationships can become extremely significant and important in someone's life, as with similar relationships within systems. We should accept that it may be important to recognise a 24/7 relationship with a day collar in the same way we do a marriage with a wedding ring, and not stigmatise such practices. A similar degree of understanding must also be given to pets and their owners, mommies/daddies and their littles, and so on. The relationship need not be 24/7, allowing for fluid identification as needed (often who needs to be the kid getting cared for flips back and forth in my relationships and system). And while there may be discomfort or triggers associated for some, accommodating this can happen on a case by case basis, avoiding foregrounding or referring to these relationships where necessary, or adjusting what language is used depending on the rules or needs of a space. What is crucial is making sure there are spaces where these relationships can be talked about openly, normalising their existence rather than banishing them to a realm of unspeakable stigma.","title":"Part 4: Family"},{"location":"shorthanding/#part-5-gender-philosophy","text":"","title":"Part 5: Gender Philosophy"},{"location":"shorthanding/#51-the-material","text":"When reasoning about trans identity and gendered oppression, from a specifically transfeminist lens, words can hold quite specific theoretical meanings (as with most academic fields). In these contexts we may use \"transfem\" and \"transmasc\" to refer to specific relationships to gender assignment and the directions these assignments are transgressed. The same procedure may be denied to a trans youth but pressured onto an intersex youth, based on which genders the medical, legal and social systems around them have decided they each should be. This is the process of gender assignment. At the same time, how someone transgresses the gendered order is perceived differently based on the nature of the transgression. Feminine gender expressions are devalued, associated with artificiality, and thus transfeminine gender expressions are most strongly marginalised within society. This is the phenomena of transmisogyny ( Serano 2007 ). On a personal and a practical level, as a transfem system, while some of our headmates identify as boys and have corresponding self images, our body being transfeminized makes all of us subject to institutional transmisogyny. We know the history of how bodies like ours have been simultaneously fetishized and reviled, and that people like us are more often than not the primary target of trans panics. Plurality can also create a number of strange intersections with the forces of transphobia and misogyny. We notice the ways a boy fronting and performing a more masculine gender will often be taken more seriously. Even when presenting as a feminine boy in a transfem system, there can be more insulation from having your gender undercut by misgendering, and this often makes it easier for some headmates to front than others. The repeated subtle cissexism of being treated better when you present like your assigned gender (or the sexism of being treated better for presenting as a guy) and have the corresponding headmates in front, can be a really pernicious force on a system.","title":"5.1 - The Material"},{"location":"shorthanding/#52-the-metaphorical","text":"To position a boy in a transfem system as \"cis\" however, can feel reductive. Such headmates may have been active participants in decisions to feminise a body (and may reasonably consider themselves also transfeminine as a result), but they may also have had to actively work to make that same body also accommodate them. And for many transgender systems, headmates whose genders align with their assigned gender can be put in strange positions, sharing a number of experiences with those transitioning in the opposite direction. A boy in a transfem system that has medically transitioned may find they need to bind in order to front comfortably, or use a packer post bottom surgery. A girl in a transmasc system may similarly find herself needing to shave facial hair, or use breast-forms after top surgery. What gender technologies a given headmate uses to help present in a way that works for them, given the bodily compromises the system has had to make, can leave a headmate with contradictory experiences. Often this leads to using convenient shorthands along the lines of \"Our system is transfem, but I'm transmasc\" or vice versa. (Fictive identities and internal self perceptions may also bring one to this kind of metaphor, albeit for slightly different reasons.) While this may seem to conflict with the earlier definition of these terms, understanding this as a shorthand can provide clarity here. While it would be obviously inappropriate for a boy in a transfem system to insert themself into a discussion of transmasculine experiences and speak as an authority on the topic, or for a transmasculine system to use \"well some of my headmates are transfem\" to claim they cannot benefit from structural transmisogyny, these shorthands are, in my experience, generally not being used in such a way. Rather, like any seemingly contradictory use of labels, these identifications are usually meant to draw out the tensions between the two terms and gesture at a range of shared or difficult to articulate experiences. Use of such shorthands still requires care, and there's a number of less obvious pitfalls to be aware of. Implications of a headmate as \"transfem because they're a girl with a dick\" or \"transmasc because they're a boy with tits/a pussy\" are going to read as transphobic, even if that\u2019s the professed identity and self concept of a given headmate. Simply put, those traits are not what makes someone trans, and are not universal traits among those trans populations. Similarly, a headmate wanting or having a set of sex/gender characteristics outside the binary would not make them intersex (unless the system already was), because that term refers to a specific relationship to gender assignment. We are in the messy deep end of shorthanding now, and it pays to talk to the people around you about your language use and make sure they're comfortable how you use these shorthands.

While it's possible to respond productively on these terms (articulating, say, the differences between natural linguistic contact and linguistic appropriation), I think it's often much easier to avoid the moral argument, and take a more pragmatic tack on these discourses. Put simply, if you carelessly pick up a bunch of words and cultural signifiers without regard for their original meanings, it's gonna look embarrassing . Putting on a bad blaccent will get you side-eyed from people who understand the dialects you're crudely imitating, and can tell it isn't natural for you.

Bottom line, these identifications do and will exist, whether we like it or not. It's important here, to make sure we have some distinctions clear; Physical features/Appearance: how someone looks. Race: the social construct. Created by processes of racialization and oppression. Historically contingent and separate from the racialized features it is mapped onto. Culture: the collections of beliefs, language and practices shared by a particular social or ethnic group. Take the case of a white US-American system with a \"black\" headmate. While their headmate may share a number of perceived features with black Americans, they will not have the same experiences of racialization, and will likely have some distance from black culture. The same way a black American therian won't lose their experiences of racialization and culture even if they'd prefer to be perceived as a wolf. Simply put, experiences of racialization and culture exist irrespective of internal appearance and identity. \"Is my furry headmate white? I mean they're not even human\" is a confusion solved by simply separating your concept of \"race\" from how someone looks. Keeping a clear head about these distinctions when discussing these topics is essential. If we know which things we're referring to and everyone involved is on the same page, shorthanding around racialized features may be possible, similar to how we conceptualised gender. But it's again important to be conscious of how and where you invoke these shorthands, and I'd advise greater caution here. It would be obviously inappropriate to use a headmate's appearance as an argument for your epistemic authority in discussions of race, but its also important to avoid seeming to trivialise these matters more generally. This is also where the prior discussion of optics and \"bad looks\" becomes important. The question of, say, how a fictive of a character from another culture should present, is mostly one of pragmatics. Using a name from a culture that is not your own, artistic depictions of yourself as a race other than your body - these may all be possible in contexts with close friends who are on the same page as you with regards to these issues. But in broader public spaces its often going to be necessary to adjust your behaviour, to avoid seeming to present yourself as a race/ethnicity you are not. It can suck as a fictive, identifying strongly with your canon depiction, but needing to choose e.g. alternate names to use in more public spaces, so as not to unintentionally deceive acquaintances and come off like a white girl race-faking online, but this is inevitably worth doing. It's not a bad thing to identify with works from, or aspects of, another culture. And I don't believe plural systems, fictives, or factives, are any more prone to being disrespectful than singlets are. For any system playing too fast and loose with names they liked from an anime, or cultural practices they lack a claim to, there's a singlet who's also become obsessed with that culture and engages with it in similarly inappropriate ways. The only difference is the plural system has specific headmates to pin these behaviours on. There's certainly plenty of white rap fans singing along with the n-word, wearing dreadlocks or cornrows, or picking up aspects of hip-hop style without needing to claim they have a black headmate - some of these are obviously inappropriate behaviours, some require a level of discernment about an individuals distance from, or engagement with, the culture who's styles they are emulating. There are nuances to these matters too. Racialized systems may have more leeway when identifying with the dominant culture (a \"white girl headmate\" is more clearly a claim to identification with dominant cultural tropes than to a lack of racialization), but should still be cautious around identifications with differently racialized groups. For mixed race systems, or those who've been raised cross-culturally, there may be genuine cultural connections to multiple different groups, which may express themselves across different headmates (e.g. some headmates speaking a mother tongue better than others). What matters is having sensitivity to the cultures you're engaging with, and being authentic and open about your own experiences. Negotiating these dynamics is inevitably hard, and each system will have to find their own balance. It's important to understand the material consequences of racism, and defer to the comforts of racialized people in your life as to what kinds of shorthands they're comfortable with you using around them. But avoiding these topics entirely, for fear of getting it wrong, only prevents us from having those conversations in the first place.","title":"6.2 - Actually Talking Headmates and Race"},{"location":"shorthanding/#part-7-disability","text":"Differences between headmate self-conceptions and a system's body also come into play for discussions of disability. It's not uncommon for headmates to have differences in height, limbs, or sense organs, and while this is largely unproblematic for the 40ft tall eight-eyed dogtaur, it can become a point of discomfort where it aligns with real world disabilities. Mismatches between body and sense of self can be really painful. Dysphoria about height. Desires non-human features like a tail or claws. Outright alienation from a \"human\" body. Any feeling of wrongness like this is deeply personal and sensitive. But, while the 10cm tall faerie can use this language to describe her idealised form with ease, a headmate closer to 4ft, who's body is taller than this, will have to contend with the fact there are many people that height, some of whom are adults who've faced significant discrimination due to their stature. Phantom limbs can hurt, and many systems' headmates limbs differ from their bodies'. The werewolf headmate can wear a tail to substitute for missing sensations. The headmate who's form lacks legs, in an able-bodied system, has to be sensitive to the experiences of those with disabling limb differences. A headmate who's self conception lacks vision may find their body's sight actively painful, but significant vision impairments are still disabling within society, and its important to remain sensitive to this fact. Similarly, a \"deaf headmate\" in a hearing system still will need to be respectful in their interactions with Deaf culture and when learning sign languages, as any hearing person would. The question of how to square these realities is simply another variation on our prior discussions of shorthanding. Distinguish between internal perceptions and physical impairments. Be more careful where your language could be ambiguous as to which it refers. And talk to those in your life affected by the discrimination at hand.","title":"Part 7: Disability"},{"location":"shorthanding/#part-8-fatness","text":"","title":"Part 8: Fatness"},{"location":"shorthanding/#81-in-society","text":"When we talk about differences between headmates internally felt appearances and their systems' bodies, these matters exist on a spectrum. Race is a matter of lived experience that may shift contextually as someone moves through different cultural contexts, but is relatively static. Disability is a category many people enter at different points in their lives, but can also be lifelong. Species is essentially fixed, but good allegories and communication can shift perceptions. Gendering is deeply malleable, and often the way someone is gendered is simply down to a handful of cues the people around them have learned to make predictions from. So where in this should we place the category of \"fat\"? People who's bodies are deemed unacceptably \"fat\" are discriminated against in all layers of society. From large scale issues of medical neglect, clothing and the built environment rarely considering the needs of fat bodies, to bullying, harassment and abuse in interpersonal contexts. Many people are fat their whole lives, and most attempts to change this are actively harmful. Yet this category is malleable. Definitions of \"fat\" are not fixed, with many people leaving the category and many more entering it at any given time. It is also, straightforwardly, not wrong to want to become fatter. Intentional weight gain, be it for eating disorder recovery, weight gain kink, or any other reason, is just as beautiful an act of bodily autonomy and self-creation as gender transition or body modification (including for species affirmation).","title":"8.1 - In Society"},{"location":"shorthanding/#82-in-kink","text":"With kink based weight gain, there's a line to be walked between these tensions. Lots of fat fetish art deliberately plays with negative tropes associated with fatness, depicting it as gross, unhealthy, or a result of poor diet and lack of exercise. Bringing these tropes around your fat friends, who have likely experienced discrimination over their weight, or at least lived in the cultural milieu in which fat people are the butt of the joke across most popular media, can easily be rude or outright triggering. But not all weight related kink art is this way. I would personally credit a lot of fetish art directly with improving our own body image. Fatfur and fat fetish art that expanded our conceptions of bodies that could be desirable to be or be with (often the distinction making art \"fat fetish\" content is simply that someone is depicted as fat and desirable). Weight gain art that depicted eating and gaining weight as joyous and healing. Putting on more body fat directly helped our dysphoria, due to shifts across all of our body - not just those parts deemed socially acceptable to be larger. It is reasonable, as a fat person, to want to be kept away from the more negative tropes around weight gain kink, feedism and fat fetish art. The same way a trans woman might want to avoid forcefem and sissification kinks for the way they often treat becoming a woman as a humiliating and shameful thing. Yet in both cases we must understand these categories to not be fully separate. Many trans women come to their identities through feminisation kink spaces, and many weight gain kinksters are fat, or are becoming so (it's kind of the whole point). Barring those with unpalatable kinds of body desires from our communities only hurts our most vulnerable, though careless evocation of tropes and stereotypes can too. So we must again balance the comforts of the marginalised in our communities, with that which we find expressive or affirming.","title":"8.2 - In Kink"},{"location":"shorthanding/#83-in-plural-systems","text":"When this comes down to the matter of headmate depictions, there are a few concerns at play. For some, gesturing at the concept of \"fat headmates\" and \"skinny headmates\" can seem trivializing in ways that bristle against personal histories of oppression. Yet understanding members of our system's ideal forms as fatter allowed us to intentionally work towards that as a goal for our body. At this point the \"skinny headmates\" are those who have not kept up, associating themselves with past forms of our body, or struggling to conceptualize their aesthetics as something available to larger bodies. It's always worth taking care in the comforts of those around you, but understand people's body images as deeply personal too, and be careful when approaching any seeming mismatches in descriptions of weight. That \"fat headmate\" might also have a fat body, or a complicated and sensitive history with their body's weight too.","title":"8.3 - In Plural Systems"},{"location":"shorthanding/#conclusion","text":"We have avoided, for most of this essay, moralizing the shapes anyone's headmates take. But I do think it is productive, as a system, to think about your headmates' representations and what they reflect. Fictives often have to reject parts of their sources that they disagree with or find objectionable, and thinking about what tropes and biases may be reflected by the shape of your system is important. But it's also easy to trap yourself in a specific realm of expression based on what seems available to you: deciding you can't have a \"sexual alter\" and be forward or provocative or even hot due to self esteem issues or fears of how those behaviours would be construed, deciding to sideline the \"straight boy\" parts of your identity or sexuality in favour of those that seem more politically liberated, defaulting to seeing your headmates as skinny because being fat while being hot or having a cool aesthetic is almost never depicted in media you see. These perceptions can change, and open up new possibilities for personal expression. Maybe your body doesn't always need to change to meet your internal self, instead letting these perceptions exist in dialogue with one another: The hormones that change your body, the allegories and signifiers you adorn yourself with - horn headbands and collars, and the allowance for images of yourself to get fatter, include mobility aids, or any other part of yourself deemed less palatable by society. Accepting this dialogue between the idealised, allegorical, and physical selves opens up space to embody parts of yourself that cannot physically manifest: the space to unmask and be more of an animal, the space to age regress and connect with different parts of yourself or your history, the space to be plural itself. We have not aimed to give conclusive answers here. Language is inexact and inevitably sensitive to each persons own context. Declaring a given identity claim (or discomfort with that claim) an inherent problem would indicate a certainty I don't claim to have. What I do know, is for each of these topics, in public or private, we've watched an argument spark up that could have started on better terms. These topics are sensitive, and plural identity is often reduced to very absolute and essentialized terms. What I hope I've offered is a better starting point for talking about these issues; that you can productively engage with these perspectives and experiences, integrate them with your own, find the points where you disagree or your context is different, and take that into the world to actually have these conversations, and have them better than you would have otherwise. -mk","title":"Conclusion"},{"location":"shorthanding/#references","text":"Hale, C.
