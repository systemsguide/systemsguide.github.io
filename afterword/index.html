    <h1 id="a-systems-guide-to-plurality"><strong>A System's Guide to Plurality</strong></h1>
<hr />
<h3 id="afterword">Afterword</h3>
<p>You might be reading this as your first introduction to plurality - rest assured we're both proud of and terrified by this fact.
Our first introduction to plurality was <a href="https://morethanone.info/">more than one</a>.
At the time we found it invaluable - and it absolutely inspired us to write about plurality in a way that (through much introspection, discussion, rewrites, and self-disagreements) would eventually lead to <em>A System's Guide</em>.</p>
<p>More than one, to us, always felt like an excellent book to throw in people's faces to try and explain the personality crisis we were going through:
It's very matter-of-fact, it makes an effort to sound impartial, and it outwardly confronts a lot of reactionary sysphobic rhetoric.
But Plurality as a queer community is fledgling at best, teething at worst - and its needs change, or at least, our needs for it changed.</p>
<p><em>A System's Guide</em> is our attempt to write an introduction to plurality that also feels like a welcome - not just for singlets or for questioning plurals, but systems for whom it feels like a genuine, arms-open welcome is long overdue.
This handbook is a feeling: I don't want us to be only painted in the cold presumed-facts of our existence, or the things other people say about us - I want us to be painted in familiarity, in joy, in diversity, in defiance, and in acceptance.
So, if nobody's said it to you yet - welcome; and I mean it.</p>
<p>Thanks immensely to our co-writers, without whom this text would not have been developed into a genuine primer rather than an extension of more than one - and without whom we'd certainly trail into a confusing pointless mass of words every single paragraph.
Thanks to our friends and all the systems we've met over the years - on whom the diversity in any of our explanations rely. </p>
<p>And of course, thanks to you - and anyone else you might be - for reading.</p>
<p>-S</p>

<p>As you may have noticed, it's quite difficult to speak to the experience of every system. 
At the same time, we've simply brushed over concepts with a lot of depth. 
As such, it feels appropriate to speak to personal experience and understanding, in contrast to the objective overviewing in the main text.</p>
<p>Ahead are a mix of ramblings essays written by individual systems and members - The guide's authors, editors, and their friends.
With the intuition provided already, we hope you can interpret the potential for experiences differing to the ones within these pages - but still derive value from more detailed, personal writing.</p>
<p>This section will expand over time - feel free to skip it entirely, or to read out of order.</p>

<p><em>A System's Guide</em> is also available as a zine. Just download the <a href="/downloads/A_Systems_Guide_A7_Zine.pdf">PDF</a>, print it on A4, trim it to have symmetrical margins, and <a href="https://plix.mit.edu/facilitator-resources/how-to-fold-a-zine">fold it</a>!</p>
<p>There are also PDFs available for the <a href="/downloads/Afterword.pdf">Afterword</a> (6x A7 slip) and <a href="/downloads/Calibration_A7_Zine.pdf">Front Attitude Calibration</a> (A7 zine).</p>
