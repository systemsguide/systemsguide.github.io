    <h2 id="shattering-expectations">Shattering Expectations</h2>
<h3 id="numbers">Numbers</h3>
<p>A body and an individual is not necessarily a 1:1 relationship.
Conversely, not everyone under the plural umbrella can be modelled as "multiple people in a body".
Plurality is a queerness of cardinality, encompassing all the fuzzy lines where we can't state that 1:1 relationship in all senses.
These <em>system configurations</em> are diverse, and represent a variety of lived experiences - whether it's a system of ~7, 31, 2, 1,000,000, or 1*.</p>
<h3 id="names">Names</h3>
<p>As pluralfolk, we always lay <em>between</em> the extremes of our bodies containing one person, and of being a multiple-bodied group of people.
A system might have names for each of their members, an overall system name but no member names, a system name <em>and</em> member names, many names per member, two headmates that share a name, a few members without names, and more!</p>
<h3 id="gender">Gender</h3>
<p>Like trans-ness necessitates understanding gender as distinct from sex, plurality necessitates understanding gender as distinct from the body.
Owing to variance in that gender "gut-feeling", different parts of a system often have their own pronouns, gendered language, and relationship to words like "trans" and "cis".</p>
<h3 id="appearance">Appearance</h3>
<p>In most of our society, how you appear is a key part of your identity and individuality.
Pluralfolk can rarely make exclusive claim to the appearance of the body, so self-perception often differs between headmates - whether different styles on a similar body, or a totally different body entirely, a shared understanding of how someone appears on this <em>meta-physical</em> level can be key to making social connections.</p>
<h3 id="humanity">Humanity</h3>
<p>Like furries, therians, otherkin, and other nonhuman subcultures, the metaphysical appearance of a system member need not be human.
Without an obvious "human starting point" (the body) to dispel, pluralfolk often reach this conclusion intuitively and without fanfare.
Anthropomorphic animals, robots and machines, spirits, monsters, or software - the <em>form</em> (metaphysical appearance) of a system member helps convey and express what makes them unique.</p>
<h3 id="relationships">Relationships</h3>
<p>A notable variance in system configuration is in what stays constant between headmates.
The answer always lies between the extremes, but where exactly varies - memory might be totally contiguous, or almost completely individualised.
Headmates may share beliefs, but differ in opinions - share interests, but differ in tastes - share gender, but differ in sexuality!
With this in mind, systems may feel that relationships to others exist mostly across all headmates, individualised to each headmate, or somewhere in between - rapport accrued by one headmate always "smearing" across others to some extent.</p>
<h3 id="causality">Causality</h3>
<p>Each system has an individualised understanding of their own plurality.
Most systems have reasoning for why a plural model is right for them, but some systems additionally believe that their plural experiences owe to a specific cause.
These "causalities" - including spiritual and cultural truths, psychological mechanisms, and deliberate actions - aren't necessary to understand oneself as plural, but can help an individual system understand themselves - even if that understanding is "we are how we are - it doesn't matter why".</p>
<h3 id="words">Words</h3>
<p>As pluralfolk, we model the language used to describe our internal experiences on that of the outside world.
This language is not meant to be meaningless to an outsider, but it can't be taken at face value - as its meaning is being inscribed by the system conveying it.</p>
<p>A <em>Minotaur headmate</em> is not <em>The Bull of Minos</em>, but might resemble them.
A "sexual relationship" between headmates can sound quite serious - but in sharing a body with a libido, many see this as largely unimpactful and obviously implied.
System members with the names of fictional characters could be widely invested in displaying their attitudes and mannerisms, or they just might like the look!
System members that call eachother <em>siblings</em> might refer to a resemblance, bond, or rivalry - but could easily be using <em>sibling</em> to mean <em>headmate</em>!
System members that are described as instinctive animals, or as unintelligent, old, or young would all appear to present striking, complicating, sometimes dangerous issues in the outside world - but as with the above, this language refers to nuanced experiences that only the individual system themselves can convey the ins and outs of.
It's only through this per-system interpretation of the language we use that others can gain a genuine understanding of our experiences.</p>
