## Foreword

> Welcome to **A System's Guide (to Plurality)**, an informal crash course for systems and singlets alike!<br/>
> Here's a short overview of the contents of the site.

### Purpose

_A System's Guide_ is a multi-layered overview of plurality intended to provide a ground-up intuition for the nuances of plural experience.
Through this intuition, it aims to provide not just a passing understanding, but a familiarity with plurality sufficient to befriend a system you know - or the one inside.

What this _isn't_ is academia - every thought in these pages was acquired through observational understanding and lived experience, not by reviewing existing literature.
This is a firsthand account, so reference it that way if used.

This resource is for everyone - systems and singlets, know-alls and know-nothings - read it, share it, surpass and disagree with it, adapt it, revise it - if you're working towards understanding and acceptance, it's all yours.
