# **A System's Guide to Plurality**

---

## Foreword

This is a handbook for Plurality - a new identity umbrella encompassing likely-familiar terms such as _Split Personality_, _Dissociative Identity Disorder_, and _Multiple Personality Disorder_.

We speak to this topic from lived experience, and with honesty towards our stake: We're plural, as are our co-writers, and many of our friends. Their feelings, and the realities of their personal experiences, are what line these pages. 

This resource is for everyone - plural or not, knowledgeable or not, questioning or not. Please share it wherever it might help, and redistribute or adapt it as you see fit. We only ask that you treat this site as standalone art - and don't bother the authors for explanations or adjustments.

Thank you.
