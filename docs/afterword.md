## Afterword

### Addenda

We hope this primer was sufficient to impart you with the understanding that speaking for the experience of every system is very difficult.
You're more than welcome to stop right here! But to the aforementioned difficulty, we acknowledge that we brushed over and barely touched topics with a lot of depth to them - topics where it's more appropriate to individually speak to our personal experience and understanding, rather than act as an unbiased explainer.

Following this are bonus chapters - a mix of informal ramblings and formal micro-essays written by individual systems and members - The guide's authors, editors, and their friends.
With the intuition provided already, we hope you can interpret the potential for experiences differing to the ones within these pages, but still derive value from more detailed, personal writing.

We expect this section to expand over time - feel free to skim them in any order.

### Printable Version

_A System's Guide_ is also available as a zine - for adding to queer pamphlet racks, keeping in your wallet for emergencies, or sharing anywhere zines are celebrated.

It's designed to be printed in duplex B/W on A4, trimmed to have symmetrical margins, then folded using a standard zine fold.
With a single copy, chapters 1 and 2 have to be refolded to display chapters 3 and 4 respectively.
Alternatively, two copies can be printed to allow the full text to be read without refolding.

You can download the PDF for printing [here](/downloads/A_Systems_Guide_A7_Zine.pdf).
